The present document concerns software engineers th
at would work on further 
development of this piece of software, as well as c
lients/users of PeaZip.",0
"  
  

This is the only document so far describing PeaZip™
s software requirements.",0
"  It should be 
used by software engineers who will develop this pi
ece of software and it should be used for 
formalization of the software that is going to be d
elivered to clients/users.",0
"  Every future change in 
the requirements of this software should be made th
rough a typical procedure of change and final 
acceptance of this document.",0
"  
 
Software engineers should ask for further explanati
on or clarification, if and wherever they 
decide this is necessary and should not proceed to 
modifications without the approval of the final 
client/user.",0
"  
1-3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions 
This document applies to programmers of this projec
t, to software engineers that weal work 
on its further development and, finally, to the end
 users of this application and it aims at displayin
g 
the features of PeaZip version 2-7-1, as well as at
 providing information about the goals and the 
proper use of the software.",0
"  
 
Chapters that would interest users are: 3, 4 and 6,
 whereas the whole document would be 
of interest for software engineers and programmers.",0
" 
 1-4 Project Scope 
The piece of software to which the present document
 refers, is a file and archive manager 
application for a computer system, that offers user
 the capability of archiving,compressing and 
extracting (decompressing) files and archives.",0
"   

 
In brief, the basic functions that PeaZip features 
are: 
",0
"Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 2 
 
 Creating compressed archives, updating compressed a
rchives, extracting content of compressed 
archives, file and archive management tools(robust 
copy, split and join, fast or secure deletion, 
byte to byte comparison, calculation of a wide set 
of checksums and hashes over selected files), 
append timestamp to archive name(useful for archivi
ng and backup purpose) and two factor 
authentication(password and keyfile) for the manage
d archives.",1
"  All pre-mentioned functions™ 
parameters can be modified and adapted to user™s ne
eds and preferences from a settings™ menu.",0
"  
 The initial goal of this application was creating a
 frontend for Pea archiving utility.",0
"  However, 
after completing PeaZip™s GUI, support to many main
stream archiving and compression formats 
was added to PeaZip.",0
"  In this way, PeaZip became an 
aggregate frontend GUI for a set of Open 
Source archiving and compression utilities(full lis
t of which is provided in following chapters).",0
"  The 
fact that this application is Open Source software,
 gives its users the chance to directly take part i
n 
its development, as well as notice possible bugs or
 mistakes and make their suggestions on it.",0

 2- Overall Description 
2-1 Product Perspective 
Peazip was created for file and archive management 
in a computer system.",0
"  The initial goal 
of the application was to function as frontend for 
Pea archiving utility(which was also developed by 
PeaZip™s creator, Giorgio Tani).",0
"  However, after com
pleting the development of PeaZip UI, support 
to more archiving and compression formats (full lis
t of which is provided in following chapters) was 
added to PeaZip, allowing it to function as a singl
e, consistent frontend GUI, which exposes a list 
of options of the underlying applications.",0
"  
PeaZip works similarly to a large group of well-kno
wn applications, like WinRAR and 
WinZip.",0
"  PeaZip features, to a large degree, the sam
e features with the applications of this group 
and in addition, it supports a wide range of archiv
ing and compression formats(superset of the 
supported by each application of the pre-mentioned 
group set)as well as some file and archive 
management tools(which are mentioned explicitly in 
following chapters), while at the same time it 
offers its users the capability of executing its fu
nctions as command prompt commands(resulting 
commands can be extracted and saved in a text file)
, allowing them to monitor any running activity 
in real-time.",0
"  
  

An important attribute of PeaZip is its self-standi
ngness and its independency from the kind 
of the Operating System of the computer system on w
hich it runs.",1
"  In no case is the installation of 
any other program required for PeaZip to work, whil
e for cases that no system integration is 
preferred, PeaZip Portable is available as standalo
ne application, not needing installation and not 
modifying the host system.",1

"  
2-2 Product Features 
PeaZip is a general purpose file and archive manage
r application for a computer system, 
aiming to provide a cross-platform graphical interf
ace for many Open Source archiving and 
compression utilities.",0
"  The most important features 
that are offered by those utilities, through 
PeaZip, are the following: 
 · Creating archives in any of the supported archivin
g and compression formats(full list of 
which is provided in following chapters) 
· Updating an already existing archive 
· Appending timestamp with  date and time on the man
aged archive name for archiving and 
backup purpose 
· Two factor (password and keyfile) authentication f
or the managed files and archives 
· Extracting contents of any compressed in any of th
e supported archiving and compression 
formats (full list of which is provided in followin
g chapters) archive 
· Secure file and archive deletion from any storing 
unit of the computer system on which 
PeaZip runs 
· Byte to byte comparison between tow files 
· Check files in order to find duplicate files and t
o check files for corruption 
· Splitting files and merging split volumes back to 
original file 
· Information list, which lists contend of selected 
files/archives.",1
"  In info mode, it shows number 
of files  and archives, newer and older object™s da
te/time of last modification, total space 
occupation and larger and smaller object™s size 
· View content of a file or archive represented as h
exadecimal values 
· Graphical monitoring of all executed functions 
 ",1
"Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 5 
 
 All functions above can be modified and adapted to 
users™ preferences through a settings 
menu.",0
"  Moreover, any of those features can be execut
ed as command prompt command.",1
"  Finally, 
more than one of those features can be applied to a
 single archive or file.",1
"  
2-3 User Classes and Characteristics 
This software applies to any user of any computer s
ystem.",1
"  There is no limitation on who 
would be able to or allowed to use PeaZip, as PeaZi
p is an application that could be used by any 
user of a computer system who would like to manage 
(archiving and compression) files and 
archives of the system.",0
"  
 
PeaZip users can be divided into two main categorie
s: to the ones that have already used 
an archiving and compression application and to all
 the rest.",0
"  Even though PeaZip functions are 
relatively simple and PeaZip™s interface is pleasan
t and user friendly, users included in both 
categories, should read the tutorials and help docu
ments that have been written about the 
particular application(and are either available in 
sites that are mentioned in following chapter or 
inside the application), so as to inform themselves
 on the application scope and needs that it 
covers, as well as to be able to use in full extend
 all, featured by the application, functions-- 
 
Another distinction of PeaZip users in categories, 
could be made according to user™s 
experience and knowledge on using computer systems.",0
" 
 In this case, however, the distinction into a 
discrete number of categories is not easy, because 
it is not possible to put unambiguous boarders 
between categories according to users™ experience a
nd knowledge level on using computer 
systems, as it is a non-countable amount.",0
"  Still, in
 general, it could be claimed that users with large
r 
experience and knowledge on using computer systems,
 could use more easily some advanced 
features offered by PeaZip, such as executing its f
unction in command prompt.",0
"  
2-4 Operating Environment 
As far as operating systems are concerned PeaZip is
 compatible with: 
 · All 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 
· All 32-bit Microsoft Windows(95/98/

/2000/
P/Vista) 
· All POSIX(all versions of  Linux/all versions of B
SD/all UNIX-like operating systems) 
 
Moreover, PeaZip is available as source code that i
s compatible with almost any operating system.",1
"  
It is obvious, that PeaZip is independent from the 
operating system of the computer system on 
which it runs.",1
"  

 As far as hardware is concerned, PeaZip requires an
 x-86 compatible CPU, due to some 
performance critical sections written in ASM.",1
"  In ge
neral, CPU and RAM requisites of PeaZip, are 
bound to the chosen algorithm and compression level
, ranging from a few KB for simpler 
algorithms (like when storing files in tar/gz/zip f
ormats) to above than a GB for more complex 
algorithms and higher compression level (like LZMA,
 PPMd and PAQ).",0
" 
 Needless to say, it is the 
choice of the compression algorithm that is the mos
t important factor that determines the job's 
speed, even if usually more advanced algorithms are
 the ones that scale better in performances in 
multi-core environments.",0
"  
 
To conclude, as far as software is concerned,
 all needed software invoked by the frontend 
is included in PeaZip packages (available under sui
table licenses, as open source or royalty free) 
so no custom package is needed to be installed to m
ake PeaZip work (with the possible exception 
",1
"Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 6 
 
 of some standard gtk/gdk related libraries needed t
o run PeaZip, Gwrap and Pea binaries, which 
may be missing in some computer systems, but are we
ll known, trustable and widely available).",0
"  
 2-5 Design and Implementation Constraints 
Should anyone wish to work on further development o
f PeaZip knowledge in any of the 
following programming languages is required: 
 
· Delphi/Kylix 
· Object Pascal 
· Pascal 
 This software™s license is LGPL, which mean that Pe
aZip is 100% Open Source and 100% free 
and it can be used be linked to any other software 
regardless of whether it is free software or 
proprietary software.",0
"  Everyone that does or is goin
g to develop or use PeaZip, should agree and 
fully accept the terms of this kind of license.",0
"  

 
 Moreover, PeaZip is developed under the developmen
t environment Lazarus 
IDE(
http://sourceforge.",0
" net/projects/lazarus/
).",0

cts on file manager interface 
according to whether they are selected or not.",0
"  

 
With this feature users are allowed to flexibly alt
ernate the way of selection of 
currently displayed objects on file manager interfa
ce.",1
"  This feature is particularly 
useful for object selection for mass management, es
pecially when the number of 
currently displayed objects on file manager interfa
ce is large (thus manual selection 
object-by-object could lead to errors).",1

 4-3 Software Interfaces 
PeaZip is compatible with: 

 · All 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 
· All 32-bit Microsoft Windows(95/98/

/2000/
P/Vista) 
· All POSIX(all versions of  Linux/all versions of B
SD/all UNIX-like operating systems) 
 
Moreover, PeaZip is available as source code that i
s compatible with almost any operating system.",0
"  
It is obvious, that PeaZip is independent from the 
operating system of the computer system on 
which it runs.",1
"  

 To conclude,
 all needed software invoked by the frontend is incl
uded in PeaZip packages 
(available under suitable licenses, as open source 
or royalty free) so no custom package is needed 
to be installed to make PeaZip work (with the possi
ble exception of some standard gtk/gdk related 
libraries needed to run PeaZip, Gwrap and Pea binar
ies, which may be missing in some computer 
systems, but are well known, trustable and widely a
vailable).",0
"  
4-4 Communications Interfaces 
PeaZip is not a web application, thus its installat
ion and use does not require any 
communication interfaces™ feature.",0
"  However, connect
ion to the Internet would be considered useful 
for users, as, through it, they would be able to ac
cess on-line help and information about PeaZip.",0

"  
5-2 Safety Requirements 
This application should function even in cases of w
rong data insertion or wrong settings.",0
"  In 
case of error it should provide users with appropri
ate help messages.",0
"  
5-3 Security Requirements 
Extraction (this feature is described in previous c
hapters)of the content of encrypted(locked) 
archives through PeaZip, shouldn™t be allowed witho
ut inserting the correct password and (if 
existing) keyfile for authentication.",0
"  Moreover, rec
overing the password and the keyfile that one 
PeaZip user has inserted or set to an archive(this 
feature is described in previous chapters)by any 
other user of the computer system or the applicatio
n, through the application itself or in general the
 
computer system.",0
"  Finally, no data remains from data
 that have been selected to be securely 
deleted should be left in the storing area of the c
omputer system after the end of the procedure of 
secure deletion (described in previous chapter), in
 case of selection of this feature.",0

 Project Scope 
     KeePass Password Safe is a small system that c
an be easily transferred from computer to computer 
by a 
simple USB stick.",0
"  Its purpose is to solve a problem
 that really bothers many people today when they ha
ve to 
choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be sec
ure or to use every time the same one so they won™t
 
forget it but risk be found out by others.",0
"  So it pr
ovides you a very secure, encrypted database where 
you can 
keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email ac
counts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to 
find 
them.",0
"  That is because KeePass Password Safe can loc
k every database with only one Master Password   
and/or key file.",0
"  There are no duplicates, anywhere 
in your computer, of this Master Password and/or ke
y file 
so in case of lost database cannot be opened by any
one.",0
"  Not even by you and that is because there is n
o 
recovery password or back door.",0
"   

     KeePass Password Safe beside security also pro
vides you with several functionalities in order to 
keep 
your database organized and up to date.",0

 Overall Description 
2-1
 Product Perspective 
KeePass consists of a database which contains data 
for one or more users.",0
"  Each user™s data are divided
 into 
groups and subgroups so that they are organized in 
a form that serves right the user.",1
"  Every user has a
 unique 
Master Key which can be simple or composite and its
 combination opens uniquely the database.",1
"  If lost t
here 
is no recovery.",0
"  Groups and subgroups contain entrie
s with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be se
nt 
or copied to websites, application and accounts.",1
"  Th
ere is also the ability for a onetime key creation 
to be 
used once in a transaction without the risk of reus
ed by others for any reason.",1
"  
In the diagram below there are the main components 
of the system, subsystem interconnections and exter
nal 
interfaces to help you understand the main idea of 
KeePass.",0

ey.",1
"  The database can be opened and 
closed whenever user wants it.",1
"  Changes on the data 
are permitted and the changes can be 
saved.",1
"  The user also can print all data in order to
 keep them with him even when a computer 
is not available.",1
"  Also the user can search the data
base using key words through a search 
engine provided with the software.",1
"  Last but not lea
st, the database can be imported and/or 
exported from/to the Internet.",1
"  

 · Group/Subgroup Œ Add, Modify, Delete, Find 
Data are organized in groups and subgroups in the o
rder that user wants and finds effective.",1
"  
Those groups can be modified whenever.",1
"  New groups a
nd subgroups can be added easily 
and can be deleted the same way.",1
"  The feature of sea
rching can be applied in just one group 
and not in the whole database if wanted.",1
"  
 · Entry Œ Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete 
A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup a
nd it contains title, username, 
password, URL and notes.",1
"  Not all fields are require
d for an entry.",1
"  An entry can be 
duplicated and deleted in the click of a button.",1
"   
 · Change Language 
At KeePass website there are available language tra
nslations that can be downloaded and 
applied easily.",1
"  

 · Auto-Type 
The user can select a sequence of keypresses that K
eePass will be able to perform and send 
them to any window or browser.",1
"  

 · Command Line Options 
The user can pass a file path in the command line i
n order for KeePass to open this file at 
startup.",1
"  
 · Composite Master Key 
To open a database you must use all key sources suc
h as password, key file and/or Windows 
account details that were used when the Master Key 
was created.",1
"  All these together form the 
Composite Master Key and are all required in order 
to open the database.",1
"  So the user cannot 
use a combination of them to unlock the database.",1
"   
 · Configuration 
This feature is used to explain how KeePass store i
ts configuration and where.",0

 window and Limit to single instance 
option to run only one instance of KeePass at a tim
e.",1
"  
 · Password Generator 
There are available generations based on character 
sets and based on patterns the first for 
generating random passwords and the second for crea
ting passwords which require specific 
patterns.",1
"  There is also available generating passwo
rds that follow rules which are 
determined further down on this document.",1
"  Then ther
e are security-reducing options which 
reduce the security of the passwords they are appli
ed to.",0
"  Finally there are configuring 
settings of automatically generated passwords for n
ew entries so that a random password 
will automatically be created by KeePass when a new
 entry is wanted.",0
"  
 · Secure Edit Controls 
KeePass offers the ability for passwords and data t
o be appeared behind asterisks when the 
user wants it.",1
"  When this option is turned on, secur
e edit controls stronger than the ones of 
Windows are protecting your data and no one can acc
ess them, see them or steal them.",0
"   
 · TAN Support 
KeePass uses TAN-Transaction Authentication Numbers
 for even more security.",1
"  This 
feature can be used for generating one time passwor
ds so that there won™t be any chance, for 
anyone to access e-g.",0
"  your bank account even if he 
finds out that password.",0
"  That is because 
when the password is entered one time it becomes us
eless.",0
"  TANs can be added using the 
TANs wizard.",0
"  

 · URL Field 
The URL field supports various special protocols an
d placeholders and can be used for 
Standard capabilities where URL field can execute v
alid URLs for which a protocol handler 
is defined.",0

URLs.",1
"  Also, placeholders can be used that will be a
utomatically replaced when the URL is 
executed.",0
"  

 · Using Stored Passwords 
Passwords that are stored in the database can be co
pied to website accounts and applications 
with security and without retyping them again.",1
"  This
 can be done by several methods such us 
Context-Sensitive Password List, Drag and Drop, Aut
o-Type and KeeForm.",0
"  All of them are 
explained better further down.",0

 Design and Implementation Constraints 
 
Timing requirements in KeePass Password Safe:
  When a password is copied for any reason, (e-g.  co
py to an application, account, and website) it 
remains in the memory for only 10 seconds.",1
,0
"  After 10
 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you hav
e to 
recopy again.",0
"  That provides security in a case a pa
ssword is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one 
can 
find it out by pasting later.",0
"    

  

Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe:
  Not in all translations translated help files and 
tutorials are available.",0
"  
 
Specific Technologies used in KeePass Password Safe
:
 · In order to keep the user™s data fully protected, 2
 very secure algorithms are used: 
Cipher
 Block Size
 Key Size
 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael)
 128 bits
 256 bits
 Twofish
 128 bits
 256 bits
 In both algorithms every time the user saves a data
base, a random 128-
bit initialization                                 
                                       
vector is generated.",0
"  
· For the creation of the 256-bit key the Cipher uses
, the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-256 is used.",0
" 
  · All the bytes needed for the Initialization Vector,
 the master key salt, etc are generated via pseudo-
random sources: current tick count, performance cou

System Overview,0
The central part of the avionics architecture of NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle is a quad-redundant Flight Critical Computer (FCC) which is based on Draper's Fault Tolerant Parallel Processor (FTPP) architecture,0
" The FCC consists of four Flight Critical Processors (FCPs) operating as a quad-redundant Virtual Group (VG), five simplex Instrument Control Processors (ICPs) running as five separate VGs, five Draper Network Elements (NEs), four Multi-protocol/RS-422-cards, sixteen Digital I/O (DIO) cards, four Analog I/O cards, and four Decomm cards",0
"The FCPs, operating as a single, quad-redundant set, function as the main application processor",0
 A complete suite of Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) software will be loaded onto the FCPs and provide an Application Programming Interface (API) between NASA's application code and the underlying hardware (Motorola Power PCs) and a COTS operating system (VxWorks),0
" The FTSS software provides Scheduling Services, Communication Services, Time Services, Memory Management Services, Fault Detection and Isolation, Redundancy Management, System Support Services, and a Mission Management template",0
 A reduced set of FTSS Communications Services will be loaded onto each ICP and will provide an API between the I/O software running on the ICPs and the NEs,0

In the Normal Operation state the software meets the performance and functional requirements (other than those listed as System Initialization requirements) in the no-fault case,0
  The system will transfer to the System Initialization state if a reset exception is received,1

Scheduling Services,0
Scheduling Execution,0
"Whenever the 50 Hz timer interrupt occurs, the interrupt handler invokes the scheduler (there are various ways to implement this invocation, such as using a procedure call or by setting an event; no specific implementation is to be inferred)",1
"  The scheduler allows the application to create lists of tasks that run during a given segment of time, at various rates",1
"  The application can create ""vehicle modes"" to designate a unique segment",1
"  The application can also set up ""rate groups""",1
"  Each rate group has some number of tasks associated with it, and it also has a rate for those tasks",0
  Note that there may be some number of rate groups that have the same rate,0
  These contain the tasks that will run at that rate in different vehicle modes,0
  Some number of rate groups can be associated with a given vehicle mode,0
"  When an API call is made to change the vehicle mode, the scheduler will disable the tasks associated with all the rate groups in the old vehicle mode, and enable the tasks associated with all the rate groups in the new vehicle mode",1
  The enabled tasks are then unblocked at the rate given in its associated rate group,0
  An API call is available for the task to call to block itself when it is finished with its cyclic processing,1

The scheduler shall [SRS034] take no longer than 1 millisecond to execute scheduler and Time Services FTSS overhead tasks in each rate group,1

The FTSS software shall [SRS278] provide an API call that provides the application program the minor frame number,1
The behavior of synchronous tasks executed by the scheduler must be deterministic,1

The scheduler shall [SRS270] provide a task deadline capability that allows the application to specify which minor frame a task should start in and finish in,1
All tasks in rate groups and their corresponding schedules for all vehicle modes will be setup at system initialization,1

Exception Handling,0
"For purposes of handling exceptions, exceptions are defined as either software or hardware exceptions",0
  Software exceptions are defined as those mapped into VxWorks signals,0
  All other exceptions are classified as hardware exceptions,0
Table 3,0
2-1 shows the mapping of software exceptions to VxWorks signals,0
Table 3,0
44228,0
  Software Exception Mapping Table,0
"Upon the occurrence of an exception of either kind (hardware or software), the FCP shall [SRS172] make the error type available to the application, via an API service, for incorporation in the telemetry stream and include all context data relevant to the exception, namely the contents of the Machine State Register (MSR), and the machine status Save/Restore Registers (SRR0 & SRR1)",1
The scheduler shall [SRS031] provide a mechanism for a task optionally to define a user written software-exception-handling routine that runs in the context of the task,1
"For hardware exceptions and reserved exceptions, the FTSS shall [SRS276] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then return from the exception handler to the task that was running when the exception occurred",1
"For software exceptions occurring within the FTSS, the FTSS shall [SRS277] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then restart the offending task at its beginning",1
"For other software exceptions, regardless of whether or not a user written exception handling routine is invoked, if an exception occurs, the scheduler shall [SRS173], after making available the error type and context data to the application, resume processing (after the exception-handling routine runs, if provided) at the initialization point of the offending task",1
"For software exceptions occurring during Startup, FTSS shall [SRS301] issue a VME reset to the FCR in which the exception occurred",1
Memory Management Services,0
Memory Protection,0
"There are two types of memory violations that might occur: 1) as a result of a hardware fault or SEU and 2) as a result of a common mode (usually, software) error",0
 Memory violations that result from random hardware faults will be detected in the same way as any other hardware fault is detected in the FTPP and don't require memory protection for them to be detected and dealt with,1
" In the second case, NASA has determined that however the memory protection function is implemented, the policy will be to restart the task that is executing when a memory violation (exception) is detected",1
The watchdog timer and ground based testing will uncover some but not all of the possible memory faults,1
Communication Services,0
The FTSS communication services provide message-passing capabilities that are layered on top of the packet based network element communication hardware,1
 Messages are contiguous blocks of variable length data that are transferred from one task to another,0
 Messages are addressed with a global unique communication identifier that routes them to the appropriate virtual group (VG) and socket,1
" Associated with the message are descriptor fields describing the sender, receiver, the type of message, and how the message is to be exchanged",0
 The unique identifier for an end point consists of a virtual group identifier and a socket identifier,0
 The sending and receiving end points may live on the same virtual group or on different virtual groups,1
"Communication Services are divided into two constituent capabilities: ""Synchronous"" message services and ""Immediate"" message services",1
" ""Synchronous"" message services send and receive data on rate group frame boundaries; thus allowing safe inter-rate group communication",1
" ""Synchronous"" message services are provided by message queue sockets",1
" ""Immediate"" message services unlike ""synchronous"" message services initiate a message transfer immediately",1
" When used for inter-VG communication, ""immediate"" message services interface directly with the Byzantine Resilient Virtual Circuit (BRVC) abstraction level communications interface and force an immediate network element access",0
" ""Immediate"" message passing between virtual groups is restricted to the highest priority rate group on the FCP",1
 This restriction does not apply to the ICPs,1
" ""Immediate"" message passing within a virtual group is not restricted to the highest rate group, but must be used carefully by the application to prevent desynchronization",1
" ""Pipe"" sockets provide ""Immediate"" message services",0
Communication services provide a message passing capability that guarantees congruent use of the network element among the members of a virtual group under fault free conditions,1
"Communication services shall [SRS047] provide ""synchronous"" message passing services in the form of ""message queues""",1
"Communication services shall [SRS048] provide ""immediate"" message passing services in the form of ""pipes""",1
" ""Pipes"" provide fast data throughput between virtual groups or within a virtual group when minimal data latency is necessary",1
"Communication services shall [SRS049] provide the capability to ""broadcast"" messages to all virtual groups",1
"Communication services shall [SRS050] restrict the use of ""immediate"" message passing services between virtual groups (from FCP to ICP) to tasks running in the highest rate group on the FCP",1
 This restriction does NOT apply to the ICPs since they are running as simplex VGs,1
Communication services shall [SRS051] detect message passing between application tasks living on the same virtual group and bypass the usage of the network element,1
Communication services shall [SRS052] route messages to the proper virtual group(s) and socket,1
Communication services shall [SRS053] deliver messages in the same order at each member of a virtual group,1
Communication services shall [SRS054] perform synchronous message passing at rate group frame boundaries,1
 This ensures that all redundant instantiations of a given rate group task have consistent messages throughout the rate group frame,0
Communication services shall [SRS235] detect a babbling NE or ICP within 20 milliseconds of the receipt of the first erroneous packet,1
FTSS shall [SRS255] mask out a babbling NE or ICP within 40 milliseconds after it is detected,1
Sockets,0
"Sockets are the end points of FTSS communication, which provide a transparent interface to the BRVC communications layer and a useful interface to the application layer",0
 Sockets maintain the buffers between the underlying packet based communication primitives that directly access the network elements and the message based communication services used by the rate group tasks,0
" Sockets used for ""synchronous"" message passing behave differently than those used for ""immediate"" message passing",1
Synchronous message passing sockets shall [SRS055] queue outgoing messages until they are transmitted at frame boundaries,1
" The ""create"" and ""open"" API calls for synchronous sockets allow the application to specify the maximum message size and how many incoming messages the socket may buffer",1
"If there is insufficient space to enqueue a message for transmission, Communication services shall [SRS059] return an error to the corresponding task",1
 Sockets are non-blocking and place the burden of polling on the application task,0
Message Queue Sockets,0
"Message queue sockets allow a single task to queue a variable number of messages, each of variable length",1
 One task is allowed to receive messages from this queue,0
 Message queue sockets define a dedicated communication path between two tasks with guaranteed message delivery,1
" Message queue sockets provide ""synchronous"" communication and perform sending/receiving of messages at frame boundaries",1
Communication services shall [SRS062] provide a message queue communication mechanism that guarantees message delivery between a sending and receiving task,1
"Communication services shall [SRS063] provide an API for ""message queue"" communication",1
"Communication services shall [SRS064] provide the following error handling information as feedback to the ""message queue"" API calls:",1
"notification of invalid or out of range application specified parameters on all operations,",0
"notification of an attempt to create a broadcast message queue,",0
"message queue ""open"" of end point ( SENDER/RECEIVER ) by non-assigned virtual group,",0
"message queue is full when performing a send operation,",0
"connection/transmission error,",0
"FTSS unable to create/open message queue, and",0
notification that a received message was truncated to the buffer size provided,0
"The message queue ""create"" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers",1
" Communication services shall [SRS066] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to ""open"" the respective end of the queue",1
Pipe Sockets,0
"Pipe sockets are used for ""immediate"" communication",0
 They may be created with a broadcast capability,0
 Pipes may only be opened by one sending task,0
" Pipes may be opened by multiple receiving tasks if they are created with the ""broadcast"" capability; otherwise they may only be opened by one receiving task",0
 Pipes are the only broadcast mechanism available to the application,0
"Communication services shall [SRS067] provide a ""pipe"" communication mechanism allowing immediate message passing through the network and allowing a 50hz FCP transfer task to poll until it can read an immediate message from the ICP",1
"Communication services shall [SRS068] provide an API for ""pipe"" communication",1
"Communication services shall [SRS069] provide the capability to create ""pipe""s which ""broadcast"" their messages to all virtual groups",1
"Communication services shall [SRS070] provide the following error handling information as feedback to the ""pipe"" API calls:",1

"notification upon receiving a message that the previous message was overwritten,",0
"connection/transmission error,",0
"FTSS unable to create/open pipe, and",0
notification that a received message was truncated to the buffer size provided,0
"If the broadcast option is used, each virtual group should open the pipe and read from it to avoid flow control problems",1
"The ""pipe"" ""create"" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers",1
" Communication services shall [SRS073] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to ""open"" the respective end of the pipe",1
" In the case of a broadcast ""pipe"", communication services allows one task in each virtual group of the system to open the receiving end of the ""pipe""",1
Fault Detection and Isolation,0
Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) provides the capability to detect and diagnose faults within FCC hardware,1
  The functionality of FDI is decomposed into 2 capabilities-Initial Built-In Test (IBIT) and Continuous BIT (CBIT),0
"  FDI IBIT provides the facilities for the detection and diagnosis of faults during system initialization (at power on or CPU reset) on FCPs, ICPs, PMC 1553s, and MPCCs",1

Initial BIT constitutes a series of self-tests provided by the manufacturer of the equipment being tested,0
" Initial BIT tests constitute tests of the processors, and I/O devices",0
" Note that by configuring the network elements to automatically enter ISYNC on Power Up, there is no opportunity to perform IBIT on the NEs",0
 The fact that an NE is in sync with the other NEs will have to substitute for a separate NE IBIT function,0
FTSS IBIT executes on the Flight Control Processors (FCPs) at system initialization,0

Software Requirements Specification ",0
Introduction,0
Purpose,0
"This SRS describes the requirements and specifications of Libra, an Economy-Driven Cluster Scheduler",0
" It explains the functional features of the scheduler, along with interface details, design constraints and related considerations such as performance characteristics",0
" The SRS is intended for users and owners of high-performance clusters, cluster management software, job schedulers and grid resources",0
Scope,0
"The Libra Scheduler is intended to work as an add-on to the queuing, scheduling and resource managing module of the open source Sun Grid Engine cluster management system, previously known as Codine",0
 The scheduler will offer market-based economy driven service for managing batch jobs on clusters by scheduling CPU time according to user utility rather than system performance considerations,0
" Hence, the main objective of Libra is to provide Quality of Service (QoS) computational economy in cluster computing",1
"As part of the project, the Libra Scheduler will only manage sequential and embarrassingly parallel batch jobs to be run on a homogenous Linux cluster, although its functionality can be adapted to schedule resources other than CPU time, even on a heterogeneous cluster",1
"To provide QoS to users, there will be no mechanism for users to interact with each other, and bargain on the use of resources according to their considerations, as is provided in a grid-computing environment by projects like Nimrod/G [1]",1
"Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations",0
Cluster/Cluster Computing,0
Clustering involves connecting two or more computers together to take advantage of combined computational power and resources,1
" Hence, a cluster works as an integrated collection of resources that can provide a single system image spanning all its nodes",1
" Clustering is a popular strategy for processing applications because it transparently spreads the processing of different jobs throughout the cluster, and are used for high-performance applications such as AI expert systems, nuclear simulations, and scientific calculations",0
QoS,0
"Quality of Service – meeting what users actually want, thus maximizing their utility",1
Computational Economy [2],0
Computational economy refers to the inclusion of user-specified QoS parameters with jobs so that resource management is based on a user-centric approach rather than on a system-centric approach,0
" This essentially means that user constraints such as deadline and budget are more important in determining the priority of a job by the scheduler, than system policies like ordering jobs according to the basis of submission time",0
" Currently, there is no holistic scheduling mechanism in cluster computing to enable differing QoS levels for different clients",0
Linux,0
"Linux is an open source operating system, with extensive documentation and user support",0
Grid Computing [3],0
"A grid is an infrastructure that couples resources such as computers (PCs, workstations, clusters and so on), software (for special purpose applications) and devices (printers, scanners) across the Internet and presents them as a unified integrated single resource that can be widely used",0
 Grid computing refers to using a grid for processing jobs and processes,0
Bid-based Proportional Resource-Sharing Model [4],0
"This is an economic model that specifies one way of allocating (cluster) resources between competing users based on what their criteria is, such as deadline and budget",0
" In this model, the amount of resource allocated to users is proportional to the values of their bids",0
" Essentially, in a bid-based system, the users are allocated tokens or credits, which they can use for having access to resources",0
 The value of each credit depends on the resource demand and cost at the time of usage,0
" We can modify this approach for our cluster, by evaluating this credit/priority according to the deadline and price constraints of users, and considering the system load and resources use as well",0
 This priority is then used by a scheduling policy to allocate resource proportionally to the competing jobs,0
Stride Scheduling [5],0
This is a scheduling algorithm to enforce resource allocations proportional to a user’s priority or share,0
 A pool of tickets represents resource rights to a shared resource,1
" A stride is inversely proportional to the number of tickets allocated to a job, hence representing the interval (in terms of CPU time) between two successive scheduling of a job",0
 Jobs with more tickets have shorter strides and hence are scheduled more frequently and obtain a greater fraction of the resource,1
 The algorithm is deterministic and quite accurately schedules jobs in exact proportions based on their ticket allocations,1
Process Migration,0
It is the process of moving a job from one computer system to another without restarting the job from the beginning,0
Sequential Jobs,0
"These are jobs that must be run on a single node, and cannot be split into separate jobs",0
Embarrassingly Parallel Jobs,0
"These are parallel jobs that are comprised of independent parts that can be split up and performed on separate nodes as if they are sequential jobs, with minimal inter-job communication necessary",0
 This is opposed to real parallel jobs that comprise dependent threads that need to interact with each other during the course of execution,0
Job accounting,0
It is a method of quantifying the system resources used by a job,0
GUI,0
Graphical user interface,0

Overview,0
The rest of the SRS examines the specifications of the Libra Scheduler in detail,0
" Section 2 of the SRS presents the general factors that affect the Libra scheduler and its requirements, such as user characteristics and project constraints",0
" Section 3 outlines the detailed, specific functional, performance, system and other related requirements of the Libra scheduler",0
 Supporting information about appendices is provided in Section 3,0
Overall Description,0
Product Perspective,0
"As mentioned earlier, Libra forms part of a larger system comprising the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system that runs on a Linux-based cluster",1
 SGE is responsible for receiving the jobs submitted by the user and delegating them to Libra for scheduling and placing on appropriate workstations or execution hosts,1
" Libra communicates its decision regarding workstation allocation to the resource manager, which then dispatches the job to the chosen workstation",1
" Once assignment to a workstation has occurred, Libra is responsible for implementing the scheduling policy on the jobs executing at the workstations",1
 No modifications to the Linux kernel are required,1
 The details of various interfaces have been provided in Section 3,0
9,0
Product Functions,0
The main purpose of the Libra scheduler is to maximize user utility,0
" Thus the job details submitted by the user will include job prioritization criteria: the allocated budget and the deadline required by the user, enabling the scheduler to maximize CPU utilization while remaining within the constraints imposed by the need to optimize QoS",1
"The scheduler will allocate jobs based on the job parameters, which are job specifications submitted by the user with the job, including:",1
Location of the executable and input data sets,0
Where standard output is to be placed,0
System type,0
Maximum length of run (execution time),0
Whether the job is sequential or embarrassingly parallel,0
"However, the Libra scheduler will be QoS driven: it will aim to optimize resource utilization within user-imposed constraints: thus, user satisfaction is the primary concern, as opposed to maximizing CPU utilization",0
" Thus, the two job parameters most relevant to the scheduling decisions will be:",1
Budget allocated by the user to the process,0
Deadline,0
"With support from the Sun Grid Engine, the Libra scheduler should embody the following features and functions:",0
Should be able to enforce resource allocations according to user-centric priorities,1
"Should be dynamic, and not static, which is a necessary implication of the user-centric approach, so that users who need their jobs completed in emergency and are willing to pay a high price for it, are able to get their job done through dynamic reallocation of resources even if the job is submitted later than other jobs or the system is heavily loaded",1
" Hence, the scheduler should be able to change resource limits, priorities, privileges and execution order of the submitted jobs",1
"Should be scalable, which means that its performance should not degrade with the addition of nodes and jobs to the cluster",1
"Should be configurable, and allow for various scheduling policies that can be modified to incorporate QoS parameters",1
Should be separable from the cluster management system,1
Should provide administrative security,1
"Should provide at least a basic level of job accounting, to aid in scheduling policies",1
"Should ideally provide a GUI for all components, such as for users to submit jobs and for administrators to oversee scheduling",1
"A market-based economic model for computational economy needs to be developed for the Libra scheduler, which would be responsible for the pricing and allocation of resources according to user constraints",1
" The model is the bid-based proportional resource-sharing model, which will allocate computational time to jobs according to their share determined by the priority of their jobs according to deadline and budget considerations",0
" To ensure that the actual resource allocation reflects the overall job share, the proportional stride-scheduling algorithm will be used",1
User Characteristics,0
There are essentially two classes of users for the Libra Scheduler used with the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system: the user who wishes to submit jobs for the cluster and the administrator who oversees scheduling and cluster usage,0
" The user needs to know the exact nature of the submitted job, such as the execution time as well as resources required, and must possess the technical know-how to use the interface for submitting jobs",1
" The administrator must be an advanced cluster operator, fully qualified in using Linux, SGE, and the Libra Scheduler",1
Constraints,0
The current constraints on the project are related to the provision of hardware resources to implement and test a high-performance cluster,0
" At present, a network of four Pentium- III workstations, with a 128 Mb RAM, serves as the cluster, with SGE running on top of the Linux operating system",0
" For better performance analysis, a larger number of dedicated workstations would be beneficial",0
"For testing purposes, a simulating tool needs to be used which may have to be specially designed if a generic one is not readily and freely available",0
Assumptions and dependencies,0
A number of factors that may affect the requirements specified in the SRS include:,0
The workability of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system modules such as those dealing with process migration with the scheduling policies provided by the Libra Scheduler is assumed,0
"A basic module of job accounting and payment considerations will be provided, as they are not the focus of the scheduler",0
"Users are assumed to have a fair estimate of job execution times, so that the decision to accept or reject a job is facilitated",0
Apportionment of requirements,0
"Detailed requirements with respect to the economic front-end, that is, the exact costing and pricing policy that will be used to charge users for using the cluster will be specified in a later version",1
" The pricing mechanism will not affect the scheduling policies, as they assume a given cost and budget, and schedule resources accordingly",0
"Furthermore, at present, only a command line Linux interface or the interface of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system will be used as the user and administrator interface",0
 A GUI might be added once the basic functionality is implemented,0
It also remains to be decided whether a software tool for simulation and testing purposes will be designed or a generic one that is freely available will be used,0
Specific Requirements ,0
Functionality,0
This section is organized by the processes and features encapsulated in the Libra scheduler,0
" First, three features of the overall cluster management system and its interaction with the user or administrator are described: Submit Job, View Job Status, Delete/Change Job",1
 These are linked to the inputs and working processes of the scheduler,0
" They are followed by a detailed specification of the functionality of the Libra scheduler, which are diagrammatically explained by the Data Flow Diagrams provided in Appendix B",0
 Appendix C provides the Data dictionary which should be used to interpret and understand the Data Flow Diagrams,0
Submit Job,0
Introduction,0
This functional feature deals with the end-user (can also be used by the administrator) and is facilitated by the interface of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system,0
" Hence, it is linked to the scheduler, but does not interface directly with the scheduler",0
" However, the SGE interface will need to be adapted to include additional submission parameters that a user needs to be submit, which are not already supported by SGE",1
 This may alternately be done through a command-line interface,0
Inputs,0
User Information – relevant user data such as name and authentication id that needs to be used to submit a job to the cluster,1
"Job Information – about the job that the user wants to submit, as well as already pending jobs, to determine whether the cluster can accept more jobs and can cater to the particular user job",1
 The job details are provided in the functional feature Initialize Job,0
"Cluster Information – Cluster Type and Scheduling mechanism details, Current Load Status, Submission Directions and Criteria",0
Processing,0
"The cluster decides whether it is even open for job submissions, and whether the user that is trying to submit job is a valid user or not",1
" This decision is different from the Accept/Reject Job feature described later on, which deals with the situation when the cluster is open for job submissions, but will decide on whether to accept or reject a job based on job parameters such as budget provided and deadline specified",0
Outputs,0
Boolean – Whether the cluster is accepting submission or not,0
Boolean – User verified or not,0
View Job Status,0
Introduction,0
"This feature will allow the user or administrator to view details about the job that have been submitted, and the progress of the execution of the job",1
Inputs,0
User Id and Password – to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to see the job status,1
Processing,0
"Show the user the available options about the submitted job, and information about the progress of job execution",1
 Process selected options if choices are provided to the user to view different aspects of job information,1
Outputs,0
User view of available options about jobs submitted by the user,1
Delete/Change Job,0
Introduction,0
"This feature may be available to both the user and the administrator, to cancel a job or under specific circumstances, change a job parameter",1
 Parameters such as deadline and cost are crucial to the job scheduling and would not normally be changeable,1
" However, if the user wishes to specify a different output directory or a delayed deadline, this may be permitted",1
Inputs,0
User Id and Password – to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to delete/change the job,1
Processing,0
Remove job from the queue and update cluster status,1
 Revise scheduling decisions about resource allocation to pending jobs and submission of new jobs,1
Outputs,0
"Updated cluster information and scheduling decision – CPU load, node status, queue length, quanta allocated to pending jobs, revised expected finishing deadline of pending jobs",1
" These outputs are facilitated by the functionality of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system, and are not independently produced by the Libra scheduler",0
Initialize Job,0
Introduction,0
This is a main functional requirement that prepares the scheduler for eventually scheduling and executing a job,0
" The Libra scheduler performs it once a job has been accepted by SGE, with information from the scheduler",1
Inputs,0
"The information submitted by the user about the job, as well as the job id assigned by SGE",1
Processing,0
Two processes are performed as part of this function: the details of the job are retrieved and then these details are set in variables that represent the state of the cluster and its queues,1
 The parsed parameters are passed on to the scheduling module where the job may be accepted or rejected,1
Outputs,0
The output comprises the set variables that represent job information submitted with a job,1
" Hence, the exact job details are output: Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline",1
Accept/Reject Job,0
Introduction,0
"This is the function that is responsible for determining the possibility of satisfying the user, given his budget and deadline",1
" Hence, the most important inputs are budget, deadline, and execution time, to determine whether the job can be accepted or not",0
Inputs,0
"Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline",0
"Cluster information – CPU load, node status, remaining time of pending jobs",0
Processing,0
"Based on the job parameters, the scheduler figures out a priority of the job that reflects the share of CPU time that it deserves and needs according to the specified criteria",1
" The scheduler determines whether the job can be finished by the requisite deadline, given the execution time of the job and the execution status of other pending jobs on various nodes",1
Outputs,0
The output includes a boolean value specifying whether the job has been accepted or rejected,1
" A suggested deadline or cost is given to the user, as a precondition for the job to be accepted",0
Calculate Scheduling Information,1
Introduction,0
This is the feature of Libra that decides how the job will be scheduled based on its budget and deadline,0
 It uses the Stride Scheduling Algorithm to enforce resource allocations (CPU cycles) proportional to a user’s budget and deadline,1
 It is performed by Libra once it has decided that a job can be accommodated,0
Inputs,0
"Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline",0
Processing,0
Allocate tickets to a job based on its budget and deadline and the budget and deadlines of all other jobs on the execution host under debate,1
" Calculate the stride and the pass of the job, where the stride is simply the global stride constant divided by the tickets and the pass is initially just the stride",1
Outputs,0
"Scheduling information – the job’s tickets, stride and pass",1
Determine Execution Host,0
Introduction,0
This feature decides on which node and on which queue the job will be placed for execution,1
" It is done on the basis of the job’s budget, execution time and deadline",0
Inputs,0
"Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline",0
"Cluster Information - CPU Load, Node Status, Remaining Time of Pending Jobs, Available Memory",0
Processing,0
"Libra first looks at the load on each of the hosts and sorts them in ascending order, choosing the host that is least loaded",1
 This ensures that load balancing is taken care of,0
" It then selects the appropriate queue based on whether the job is sequential or embarrassingly parallel, budget, etc…",1
Outputs,0
The chosen execution host and queue,0
Dispatch Job,0
Introduction,0
This feature takes the job and inserts it into the queue on the execution host that the scheduler had previously decided it is to be placed in,1
" This is a separate feature since the job may be able to wait for a while before it is given CPU time, allowing other jobs to complete or be scheduled earlier if their deadlines are more urgent",0
" Thus, the dispatcher decides when to actually send the job for execution",1
Inputs,0
The chosen execution host and queue on which to place the job for execution,1
Processing,0
The scheduler sends the job to the appropriate queue and it joins the competition for resources,1
Outputs,0
The scheduled job in its appropriate host and queue,0
Update Cluster Status,0
Introduction,0
"Every time a job is scheduled for execution on a host, this feature of Libra updates the cluster status",1
 This action is also performed when a job ends and is removed from the cluster,1
Inputs,0
"Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline",0
Chosen execution host and queue,0
Processing,0
Libra first reserves the amount of resources that will be required by the job on the node,1
 It then updates the execution host queue status and sends that information about the additional load on the queue and node under consideration to the central information store on the master host,1
Outputs,0
There is no output associated with this feature as it simply performs an update and does not send any results back,0
 It is a trigger that is activated every time a job is scheduled or is deleted from an execution host,0
Execute Job,0
Introduction,0
"As long as there are jobs in the queues, this feature is being run",1
 It essentially decides how to time-slice between all the jobs currently being executed,1
 These scheduling decisions are made based on the stride-scheduling algorithm,0
Inputs,0
Scheduled Job – job details and the queue and node on which that job is scheduled to run,0
"Scheduling Information – the job’s tickets, stride and pass",0
Processing,0
"It looks at all the jobs on the cluster and selects the one with the minimum pass value, and allots it a quantum",1
 The pass of that job is then advanced by its stride,1
" In case of a tie, the arbitrary FIFO job ordering is used",1
 This loop is repeated until there are no jobs left to run on a queue,1
Outputs,0
"Updated Cluster Information - CPU Load, Node Status, Remaining Time of Pending Jobs, Available Memory",0
Reliability ,0
Maintenance,0
The scheduler will not support job migration for the purpose of decreasing resource fragmentation,1
Maximum bug rate,0
There will be a maximum of 1 bug/KLOC,1
Maximum Time To Repair,0
"In case of system outage, the cluster will be down while the Linux operating system boots up",1
 This will take less than five minutes,0
Security Considerations,0
"The Libra scheduler will ensure the privacy of user job status and ensure full control over job execution, so that alteration of scheduling criteria or actual resource allocation is not possible without administrator authority",1
Performance Requirements,0
Response time,0
The maximum response time for the submission of a job will be 1 minute,1
Capacity,0
The maximum number of jobs schedulable is limited only by the capacity of the nodes to fulfill the jobs’ deadlines; there is no upper limit inherent in the Libra scheduler as such,1
Deadline sensitivity,0
"Assuming submitted statistics for jobs are accurate, the Libra scheduler will ensure that all jobs are completed with a 10% error allowance",1
Cost sensitivity,0
"Under all circumstances, the maximum cost payable as submitted by the user will be the maximum cost charged to the user",1
Supportability,0
Naming Convention,0

Introduction,0
This document defines the functional requirements of the Number Portability Administration Center Service Management System (NPAC SMS) enabling Service Provider Portability,0
This introduction gives readers a brief overview of NPAC SMS functionality,0
 It is intended to prepare you for the detailed sections that follow,0
"  If you need more information on any particular area, please consult the applicable detailed sections in the remainder of this document or the NPAC SMS Interoperable Interface Specification",0
This introduction is also meant to convey the basic course of events that give the best understanding of the system,0
 Alternate courses of events (variants of the basic course or error paths) are described in the detailed sections later in this document and in the NPAC SMS Interoperable Interface Specification,0
NPAC SMS Platform Overview,0
"The Number Portability Administration Center Service Management System (NPAC SMS) is a hardware and software platform, which contains the database of information required to effect the porting of telephone numbers",0
"  In general, the NPAC SMS can receive customer information from both the old and new Service Providers (including the new Location Routing Number), validates the information received, and downloads the new routing information when an ""activate"" message is received indicating that the customer has been physically connected to the new Service Provider's network",1
  The NPAC SMS also contains a record of all ported numbers and a history file of all transactions relating to the porting of a number,1
  The NPAC SMS shall also provide audit functionality and the ability to transmit LNP routing information to Service Providers to maintain synchronization of Service Provider’s network elements that support LNP,1
NPAC SMS Functional Overview,0
Provisioning Service Functionality,0
The new Service Provider will obtain authorization to port the customer and notify the old Service Provider according to processes internal to the Service Providers,1
  Both the old and new Service Providers can send a notification to the NPAC SMS from their Service Order Administration Systems (SOA),1
"  When the NPAC SMS receives the notification(s), it will perform certain validation checks, and attempt to match the notification received from the new Service Provider with a concurring notification that may be sent from the old Service Provider",1
"  Assuming the notifications are valid, the two Service Providers will complete any physical changes required",1
"  When the new Service Provider due date is reached, the new Service Provider can send an activation notice to the NPAC SMS",1
  The NPAC SMS will broadcast the update out in real time to each local SMS,1
"  Upon receiving the update from the NPAC SMS, all Service Providers will update their networks",1
  The NPAC SMS will record any transmission failures and take the appropriate action,1
"In the case where either the old or new Service Providers did not send a notification to the NPAC SMS, the NPAC SMS will notify the Service Provider from which it did not receive a notification that it is expecting a notification",1
"  If it then receives the missing notification and the notifications indicate agreement among the Service Providers, the process proceeds as normal",1
" If it still does not receive a notification and if it is the old Service Provider that failed to respond, the NPAC SMS will log the failure to respond and allow the new Service Provider to proceed with activation when the new Service Provider due date is reached",1
"  If it was the new Service Provider that failed to respond, the NPAC will log the failure to respond, cancel the request, and notify both Service Providers of the cancellation",1
"  If there is disagreement among the Service Providers as to who will be providing service for the telephone number, the conflict resolution procedures will be implemented (see Section 1",1
2,0
4),0
 Processes for obtaining authorization from the customer to port a number are defined by the Service Providers,1
  The NPAC is not involved in obtaining or verifying customer approval to port a TN,1
Disconnect Service Functionality,0
"When a ported number is being disconnected, the customer and Service Provider will agree on a date",1
 The current Service Provider will send an update indicating the disconnect to the NPAC SMS,1
 The NPAC SMS will broadcast the update to all Service Providers based on the disconnect effective date and remove the telephone number from its database of ported numbers,1
" Upon receiving the update, all Service Providers will remove the telephone number from their LNP databases",1
 The NPAC SMS will log the update in history,1
 Calls to the telephone number will be routed as a non-ported number,1
Repair Service Functionality,0
A problem will be detected either by a Service Provider or by a customer contacting a Service Provider,1
There will be audit capabilities in the NPAC SMS to aid in isolating problems,1
" If an inaccuracy is found, the NPAC SMS will supply the correct data to any local SMS requesting updates",1
Conflict Resolution Functionality,0
"If Service Providers disagree on who will serve a particular line number, the NPAC SMS will place the request in the ""conflict"" state and notify both Service Providers of the conflict status and the Status Change Cause Code",1
  The Service Providers will determine who will serve the customer via internal processes,1
"  When a resolution is reached, the NPAC will be notified and will remove the request from the ""conflict"" state by the new Service Provider",1
  The new Service Provider can cancel the Subscription Version,1
Disaster Recovery and Backup Functionality,0
"If there is unplanned downtime, the NPAC will assess how long the primary machine will be down",1
  The NPAC will notify all of the Service Providers of the situation and planned action by electronic notification and telephone calls to the Service Providers' contact numbers,1
  The Service Providers will attempt to switch to the backup NPAC,1
Order Cancellation Functionality,0
"If a Create Subscription has been sent by only the new Service Provider, the new Service Provider may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version",0
"  If a Create Subscription has been sent by only the old Service Provider, the old Service Provider may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version",1
"  If both Service Providers have sent a Create Subscription, either may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version",1
"  If both Service Providers concur with the cancellation, the NPAC SMS will set the Subscription Version to canceled and notify both Service Providers that the Subscription Version has been canceled",1
  If cancellation concurrence is not provided by the new Service Provider the Subscription Version is placed in conflict by the NPAC SMS,1
"  If cancellation concurrence is not provided by the old Service Provider, the Subscription Version is set to cancel by the NPAC SMS",1
Audit Request Functionality,0
An audit function will be necessary for troubleshooting customer problems and also as a maintenance process to ensure Subscription Version data integrity across the entire LNP network,1
 Audits will be concerned with the process of comparing the NPAC SMS view of the LNP network’s Subscription Version data with one or more of the Service Provider’s views of its network,1
"  In the case of “on demand” audits, audits may be initiated by any Service Provider who has reason to believe a problem may exist in another Service Provider’s network",1
"  These audits are executed via queries to the appropriate Service Provider’s network, and corrected via downloads to those same networks",1
"In addition, Local Service Providers will be responsible for comparing database extracts of Subscription data written to an FTP site by the NPAC SMS with their own versions of the same Subscription data",1
"In a third scenario, the NPAC SMS will select a random sample of active Subscription Versions from its own database, then compare those samples to the representation of that same data in the various Local SMS databases",1
  All three of the methods outlined above are designed to help ensure data integrity across the LNP network,0
Report Request Functionality,0
The NPAC SMS supports report generation for pre-defined and ad-hoc reports,1
"  The report generation function creates output report files according to specified format definitions, and distributes reports to output devices as requested",1
"  The report distribution service supports distribution to electronic files local/remote printers, e-mail and FAX machines",1
Data Management Functionality,0
"The NPAC SMS will support functionality to manage network, Service Provider, and Subscription Version data",1
NPAC Network Data,0
"The NPAC SMS contains data, which defines the configuration of the LNP service and network",1
"  This includes such data as: participating Service Providers, NPANXXs that are portable, and LRNs associated with each Service Provider",0
Service Provider Data,0
"The Service Provider data indicates who the LNP Service Providers are and includes location, contact name, security, routing, and network interface information",1
Subscription Version Data,0
The subscription data indicates how local number portability should operate to meet subscribers' needs,1
NPA-NXX Split Processing,0
"For an impending NPA split, there is no communication between each SOA and the NPAC via an electronic interface (SOA, LSMS, or NPAC Administrative Interface) other than providing the NPAC with the new network data (LRNs and NPA-NXXs), if applicable",0
"  The NPAC inputs via the NPAC Administrative Interface the information for the NPA split (the current NPA, the new NPA, and the affected NXXs) plus the beginning and end date of the permissive dialing period",0
  This function of the NPAC Administrative Interface is only available to NPAC Operations personnel,1
The NPAC will update its subscription version records when permissive dialing starts to the new NPA,1
  During the permissive dialing period the NPAC will accept messages with either old or new NPA but broadcasts/downloads with the new NPA only,1
"  In addition, all notifications and responses to the SOA system will contain the new NPA only during the permissive dialing period regardless of whether the SOA system is using the old or new NPA in its requests to the NPAC SMS",0
"  If a delete request is received, it is broadcast with the new NPA",1
  The subscription version ID that the NPAC SMS is aware of for the TN is used in the messages,1
"Based on information from the LERG, the service providers will update their networks/LSMS to accommodate the permissive dialing period and will update the data in their networks/LSMS after permissive dialing ends",1
  There is no communication from the NPAC to cause these updates to occur,0
   No assumptions are made about what the LSMS does during the permissive period to track the NPA-NXX split for a subscription version,0
"After permissive dialing ends, the NPAC removes any old NPA-NXXs and/or NPA-NXX-Xs related to the NPA Split that are no longer valid, and broadcasts these network data deletes to the appropriate SOAs/LSMSs",1
"  Additionally, the service providers can remove any old LRNs that are no longer valid due to the split, if any, via an electronic interface (SOA, LSMS, or NPAC Administrative Interface)",1
Business Days/Hours,0
"For support of service providers that have different needs for business hours and days available for porting, two types of business days/hours have been defined in the NPAC SMS",1
  The two types are long and short business days/hours,1
The following table illustrates the outcome of business hours/days to be used based on the possible combinations:,0
Table 11 Business Day/Hour Behavior,0
Timer Types,0
"For support of service providers that have different needs for timers available for porting, two types of timers have been defined in the NPAC SMS",1
  The two types are long and short timers,0
The following table illustrates the outcome of timers to be used based on the possible combinations:,0
Table 12 Timer Type Behaviour,0
Recovery Functionality,0
"The NPAC SMS provides a mechanism that allows a Service Provider to recover messages sent to either the SOA or LSMS, during a period of time that the Service Provider was not available to receive messages from the NPAC SMS",1
"  This recovery mechanism (also referred to as resynchronization) is initiated when a Service Provider’s SOA or LSMS re-associates to the NPAC SMS, by setting the recovery mode indicator to TRUE on the Access Control structure, then requests the recovery of missed messages, by requesting the missed Network Data, Subscription Versions and Notifications",1
"The SOA requests network data and notification data for a specific period of time from the NPAC SMS, which is sent by the NPAC SMS as requested",1
" During the recovery process, new messages are queued on the NPAC SMS",1
"  Additionally, during the recovery process, the “x by y” retry functionality (where “x” is the number of attempts, and “y” is the interval in number of minutes in between attempts) continues on the NPAC SMS, but message sending is suspended to the SOA, and the retry attempts counter is not decremented, as long as the SOA is still in recovery mode",0
"  Once the recovery is finished, the SOA sends a recovery complete message to the NPAC SMS, which in turn triggers the NPAC SMS to send the previously queued messages to the SOA, at the next normally scheduled retry interval",1
"  At the completion of sending the previously queued messages, the interaction between the SOA and the NPAC SMS resumes for normal message processing",1
"The LSMS recovery functionality works similar to the SOA, with the addition of recovering subscription data",1
Network Data Recovery,0
"Network Data Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider for both SOA and LSMS to capture, via a recovery process, all network data downloads that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider",1
  The processing steps for this functionality include:,0
The Service Provider system sends a network data recovery request to the NPAC,1
"The NPAC takes the time range in the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value",1
"If the time range exceeds the tunable value, a DownloadReply is returned to the SP system with the status field populated with value 2, signifying “time-range-invalid”",1
  No network data will be included with this reply,0
"When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the network data recovery action and re-issue the request",1
Subscription Data Recovery,0
"Subscription Data Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider’s LSMS to capture, via a recovery process, all subscription data downloads that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider",0
  The processing steps for this functionality include:,0
The Service Provider system sends a subscription data recovery request to the NPAC,1
"The NPAC takes the time range in the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value",1
"If the time range exceeds the tunable value, a DownloadReply is returned to the SP system with the status field populated with value 2, signifying “time-range-invalid”",1

Notification Recovery,0
"Notification Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider for both SOA and LSMS to capture, via a recovery process, all notifications that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider",0
  The processing steps for this functionality include:,0
The Service Provider system sends a notification recovery request to the NPAC,1
"The NPAC retrieves the records that match the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value",1
"If the number of records exceeds the tunable value, a NetworkNotificationRecoveryReply is returned to the SP system with the status field populated with value 3, signifying “criteria-too-large”",1

Number Pooling Overview,0
"At the present time, the National Number Pooling approach includes the following:",0
Pre-Port 1K Blocks to a single switch (i,0

", all Pooled TNs contain same LRN)",0
"EDR (Efficient Data Representation) is captured through the use of “1K Blocks” in the NPAC, and over the SOA-to-NPAC and NPAC-to-LSMS interfaces",0
"The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information in the NPAC is a representation of the 1K Block managed by the Pooling Administrator, and represented in the LERG",0
"The NPAC Customer SOA NPA-NXX-X Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider accepts NPA-NXX-X downloads from the NPAC (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no) to their SOA via the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface",0
"The NPAC Customer LSMS NPA-NXX-X Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider accepts NPA-NXX-X downloads from the NPAC (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no) to their LSMS via the NPAC SMS-to-Local SMS Interface",0
The NPAC Customer Data Model (logical) and Service Provider Profile (physical) refer to the same information,0
"The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information is broadcast over the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface to all Service Providers in that NPAC region (exclusive of those that have filters for that NPA-NXX, and those who have a SOA NPA-NXX-X indicator in the Customer Data Model set to FALSE), for the block allocation of NPA-NXX-X data to the NPA-NXX-X Holder",0

"The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information’s “Effective Date” is the date the LERG, the Pooling Administrator, and the NPAC, consider to be the “ownership switchover” date for the 1K Block from the Code Holder (NPA-NXX owning SP) to the Block Holder (NPA-NXX-X owning SP)",0
"At the time of NPA-NXX-X creation, the NPAC will check for ""pending-like, no-active"" SVs or “pending-like Port-To-Original” SVs",1

"Once the NPA-NXX-X has been created on the NPAC, the Code Holder is prohibited from performing intra-service provider ports",1
"  If TNs were missed during the Code Holder's pre-donation intra-port activities, then NPAC personnel only are allowed to perform these intra-service provider port creates of SVs with no previously active SV, on behalf of the Code Holder",1
"  The NPAC will allow NPAC personnel, via the OpGUI, to create these LISP ports up to the effective date (11:59p of the day prior to the effective date), and to activate these LISP ports up to the Block’s activation date/time",0
  The Code Holder can also assist in the activation of the LISP ports up to the Block’s activation date/time,1
"Once the NPA-NXX-X's Effective Date has been reached, but prior to the Block’s activation, snapback messages will go to the Block Holder, and default routing will be the responsibility of the Code Holder",1
  The exception to this is during the de-pool process for the NPA-NXX-X (see #31 below),0
"Once the Block has been created (the record exists in the NPAC SMS and the Creation Timestamp in the Object has been set) in the NPAC, either from a scheduled event on the NPAC, or from a Service Provider SOA sending up the Block, then NPAC processing considers the Block to be “activated” for the Block Holder, and all snapback messages and default routing will go to the Block Holder",0
"The Block Holder Information is broadcast over the NPAC-to-LSMS interface, when the SP’s LSMS EDR flag in the Customer Profile record in the NPAC, is set to TRUE (non-EDR LSMSs get individual SVs, since the SP's LSMS EDR flag is set to FALSE)",0
The Block Holder Information’s “Activation Timestamp” is the date/time the NPAC broadcasts block or SV data to the applicable LSMSs,0
  Only at this point in time are all SPs notified of the “ownership switchover” date for the 1K Block from the Code Holder (NPA-NXX owning SP) to the Block Holder (NPA-NXX-X owning SP),1

"If during the broadcast of the Pooled Data (Blocks and SVs), one or more Service Providers cause the Block to go into a Partial Failure or Failed status, the NPAC will generate a unique alarmable message, and NPAC Personnel will be notified of the error, only when the SOA Origination is FALSE (if value is TRUE, existing M&Ps for partial failure or failed conditions will be used)",1
  M&P will be established to have NPAC Personnel resolve the broadcast failures with the Service Providers on the Block’s Failed SP List,1
"The NPAC will execute a background process, once a day, to check for Block completeness",1
"  During this background process, the NPAC will check for active blocks that haven’t been verified to contain 1000 SVs (combination of POOL, LISP, LSPP) for that Block",1
"  This is designed to capture any “disconnect requests that were sending on it’s way to old”, which may result in an orphan TN that does NOT have an Active SV",0
"  This background process will be run for the first time within 24 hours of Block Creation (with an Active status), and once every 24 hours thereafter for incomplete Blocks",0
"  For missing TNs that are identified during this process, the NPAC will create, activate and broadcast the missing SVs to non-EDR Local SMSs (i",0

", self-fixing create, activate and broadcast of missing SVs)",0
"  Once all 1000 TNs have been accounted for in the NPAC, this Block will no longer be checked by the NPAC",1
"The NPAC will manage the synchronization of, and maintain the integrity of, the data between a Block and the subordinate Pooled Subscription Versions within the Block",1
"  This means that, at all times, the LRN and GTT routing data for the Block and all SVs with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, will contain the same values",0
"  The status for the Block and status for each SV with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, may not always contain the same value",0

"  Once they are cleaned up, NPAC personnel will await notification from the Pooling Administrator prior to attempting the NPA-NXX-X deletion again",0
The NPAC performs a “cascading delete” when processing an NPA-NXX-X Deletion,1
"  This includes sending deletes of Pooled SV data to non-EDR LSMSs, and sending deletes of Block data to EDR LSMSs",0
"  Once all LSMSs have successfully deleted the Pooled data (the status of all SVs and the Block is Old, and both Failed SP Lists are empty), the NPA-NXX-X is deleted",1
"  Similar to the NPA-NXX-X Creation, the NPA-NXX-X Deletion is broadcast to the appropriate Service Providers, based on the values in their NPA-NXX-X Indicators",1
"During the de-pooling process, the vacant number treatment responsibility and snapback for TN re-assignment notifications have unique behavior, once the Block has migrated to a status of Old",0
"  As defined in #14 above, snapback messages will go to the Block Holder, and default routing will be the responsibility of the Code Holder, once the NPA-NXX-X's Effective Date has been reached",0
"  However, in this de-pooling situation, both snapback messages and default routing responsibility will be the Code Holder",0
"  So, even though the NPA-NXX-X still exists, it has the same behavior as the “pre-effective date” NPA-NXX-X situation",0
"Once the Block has been deleted in the NPAC, then NPAC processing considers the Block to be “deleted” for the Block Holder, and all snapback messages and default routing will go to the Code Holder",1
"  Additionally, the Block is now available to be allocated to another Service Provider",0
"For NPA Split processing, at the start of the Split, the NPAC SMS will automatically create a New NPA-NXX-X to correspond to the Old NPA-NXX-X, and will reject the NPA Split request if the New NPA-NXX-X already exists at the time of the NPA Split entry",1
"  The NPAC will remove the New NPA-NXX-X and convert the Block and SVs back to the Old NPA-NXX, if the New NPA-NXX is removed from the NPA Split, prior to the end of PDP",1
"  When adding an NPA-NXX-X during an NPA Split, the NPAC will automatically add a corresponding New/Old NPA-NXX-X for an NPA-NXX involved in a Split",1

e,0
", either the Old or New NPA-NXX can be sent to the NPAC, but the NPAC will broadcast the New NPA-NXX)",1
"The NPAC Customer LSMS EDR Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider uses Efficient Data Representation on the Local SMS (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no)",0
"The two new objects that will be broadcast over the interface include the NPA-NXX-X (1K Block) block allocation, and Block for EDR compatible Local SMSs that represent the 1000 TNs of POOL'ed numbers as the 1K Block",0

Audit Administration,0
Overview,0
An audit function will be necessary for troubleshooting a customer problem and also as a maintenance process to ensure data integrity across the entire LNP network,0
 Audit will be concerned with the process of comparing the NPAC view of the LNP network with one or more of the Service Provider’s view of its network,0
"  In the case of “on demand” audits, audits may be initiated by any Service Provider who has reason to believe a problem may exist in another Service Provider’s network",0
"  Such audits are executed via queries to the appropriate Service Provider’s network, and corrected via downloads to those same networks",0
  Requirements pertaining to these requirements are given in Sections 8,0
2 through 8,0
6,0
"With audits, two different scenarios are supported, one designed to “sync up” the information contained in the various Local SMS databases with the content of the NPAC SMS database, the other for the NPAC to perform random integrity checks of its own database",0
The local SMS will be responsible for comparing database extracts written to an FTP site by the NPAC SMS with its own version of that same data,1
  Note that the Service Provider network may contain several network nodes designated for local number portability and may also choose to keep its own copy in its respective SMS,0
"  In the second scenario, the NPAC SMS will select a random sample of active Subscription Versions from its own database, then compare those samples to the representation of that same data in the various Local SMS databases",0

"	Encryption Key Exchange",0
The mechanized interface to NPAC SMS requires an exchange of the encryption keys used to verify digital signatures,0
" This exchange will consist of a file containing the 1000 key list, and an acknowledgment of receipt of the list will consist of a file containing the MD5 checksum value of each key in the list",0
 The formats for these files is described here,0
Key Exchange File,0
The following table shows the format of the encryption key exchange file,0
" This file consists of some header information, followed by 1000 instances of key information",0
" There are no separators of any kind between the individual fields, between the header and key data, or between each set of key data",0
Table D- 1 -- Encryption Key Exchange File Format,0
"
Key Acknowledgment File",0
"Before a key list may be used, the sender must receive a key acknowledgment file",0
 The key acknowledgment file serves two purposes:,0
Verify that the key list has been received by the intended recipient,0
Verify the correctness of each key in the list,0
"Furthermore, the need for an acknowledgment of this kind is specified in requirement R7-108",0
2,0
" Once this file has been received, the sender of the key list can put the list into active use",0
Table D-1 below shows the format of the encryption key acknowledgment file,0
" This file consists of some header information, followed by 1000 instances of key hash information",0
" There are no separators of any kind between the individual fields, between the header and key hash data, or between each set of key hash data",0
 The MD5 hash value will be calculated from the public modulus value of the key,0
Table D- 2 -- Encryption Key Acknowledgement File Format,0
Key Exchange using PGP,0
"LNP Key exchange can be accomplished via email, ftp or an exchange of physical media using PGP for security",0
" Using PGP, a Service Provider will generate a pair of keys, one private and one public",0
 The Service Provider will transmit the public key to the NPAC,0
" This may be done via email or ftp, or any other mechanism of exchanging files",0
 The key in this file is then saved by the NPAC’s PGP program,0
" This key can now be used to encrypt files that only the Service Provider may decrypt, even if the key is intercepted by someone, it will not matter, they cannot use it to do anything other than encrypt messages for the Service Provider",0
"At this point, the NPAC can encrypt a file containing the keys for the Service Provider",0
" This file may be emailed, put on the ftp site, or put on a disk for the Service Provider",0
"For LNP key lists that the Service Provider must provide to the NPAC, the reverse procedure would apply",0
 First the NPAC would send a public key to the Service Provider,0
" The Service Provider then encrypts their key list using the public key, and somehow gets the encrypted file to the NPAC",0

"The MMF has approved SWIFT (ISO15022 standards) as the communication protocol and STRATE has recommended that the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages be used as the format for the messages, as detailed in Appendix B to K.",0
  The content and format of the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages will require approval from the MMF and NMPG before finalisation and acceptance by the JSE.,0
"The MMF requires that the JSE provide ISINs automatically in response to an electronic request (SWIFT), as the immediacy of the issuance of an ISIN is essential for the trading, and electronic clearing and settlement of money market instruments.",1
  The MMF estimates an issuance requirement of approximately 200 to 500 ISINs per day.,1
  To distinguish money market instruments ISINs from equities (ZAE) and bonds (ZAG) the MMF has requested the use of an ISIN prefix of ZAM.,1
"Pursuant to the STRATE/UNEXcor merger, as noted above, it has been agreed that the SWIFT messages to create, amend or delete an ISIN for money market instruments would be routed via STRATE, and the interaction would therefore be limited, from the JSEs perspective, between STRATE and the JSE for the issuance of ISINs.",0
The automated ISIN Issuance for Money Market Instruments system will be implemented by the JSE in the 2nd quarter 2004.,1
"The Systems Component Model, set out in Figure 1 below, was sourced from the MMF document: ""Money Market Dematerialisation Blueprint"", December 2002 and is included in this document for illustrative purposes.",0
"
The Conceptual Model set out in Figure 2 below, is an adaptation of the Systems Component Model set out in Figure 1, to represent the participation of the JSE, in its capacity as a NNA, in providing the ISINs to STRATE as CSD/IOR.",0
 This is included in this document for illustrative purposes.,0
The Trading component refers to either a system (Trading or Reporting Engine) or the act of reaching a contractual agreement (i.,0
e.,0
The JSE’s ASD department will be required to develop a programme for the automatic issuance of ISINs for money market instruments.,0
" This will include a programme to ""unstring"" the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages and “string” the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages, as detailed in Appendix B to K, for the request and notification of ISINs by/to STRATE.",0
 To differentiate between the JSEs current SWIFT BIC codes and ensure correct routing and message identification the JSE will apply for a new branch code “ISN” as an extension of their current BIC address.,0

e.,0
ANNA and ISO determine the rules regarding issuing and deleting ISINs.,0

"Further market rules regarding issuing, amending and deleting ISINs required will be provided by the JSE.",0
The JSE and STRATE will enter into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that sets out all the arrangements pertaining to the service provided by the JSE and will include a Business Continuity Plan(BCP).,0
 This will be made available to money market participants for their perusal and reference.,0
"Category 1:	Discount based, fixed term, where the MMI is bought at a discount and the nominal value is repayable on maturity.",0

These generic characteristics together with the approved the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages formats and contents will determine the fields required in the Money Market ISIN Issuance programme.,0

In the interim the issued amount will not be required.,0

 Introduction  Privacy and security policies for web-based systems are often developed as an afterthought.,0
" The implications are significant because the systems requirements, policies and functionality are often misaligned and/or in conflict with each other.",0
 Organizations risk customer mistrust based upon customer perceptions of conflicting privacy statements.,0
 The identification of high-level goals is fundamental to requirements analysis specification process.,0
 This can be achieved by asking 'why' questions about the operational descriptions of the system available.,0
 Goals are important in the requirements engineering process because they bring completeness and ease of readability to the requirements.,0
 They also provide rationale for requirements and help detect conflicts.,0
" On the other hand, scenarios are used to specify desired behavior of the system and are the means of communication among stakeholders.",0
" Additionally, they support trade-offs amongst design alternatives.",0
" Based on the utility of goals and scenarios, there is a need to develop a tool, which will assist analysts in the scenario and goal mining, reconciliation and management processes.",0
 The tool aims to maintain a goal and scenario repository for use in continuing analyses of policies and other documents from which goals and scenarios can be derived.,0
  All goals are fully traceable to the policies in which they are stated and are distinguished as either policy goals (strategic goals) or scenario goals (tactical goals) in each policy.,0
" This tool will provide strong management, which will offer flexible user defined conditions (like ID, keywords, taxonomy, subject, actor, and occurrences).",0
 The tool will also support automatic multi-user analysis results comparison.,0
" For example, each analyst can classify goals separately and the tool can automatically check the differences in their classification results for their resolution.",0
" Requirements engineers, Chief Privacy Officers (CPO), policy analysts or auditors will be able to use this tool.",0
 This document specifies the services that the tool will provide and the constraints under which the system must operate.,0
 It contains the following sections:   Description of Modules: This section contains a detailed description of the contents of each module.,0
 FR: Functional Requirements: This section specifies the operational services that the tool will provide to its users.,0
" NFR: Non-Functional Requirements: This section specifies the properties like accuracy, performance etc.",0
 that the tool must satisfy.,0
 SPR: Security and Privacy Requirements: This section specifies security and privacy related requirements that ensure security of all sensitive data.,0
 Requirements Traceability Matrix: This section graphically displays requirements dependencies.,0
" Document Revision History: This section outlines the version of the current document being used, the people responsible for the document, dates the document is modified and the changes made to the document.",0
 Appendix: This section contains a glossary of the terms used throughout this document.,0
" Additionally, it contains a bibliography of the references used in this document.",0

 Module Breakdown  The SPRAT will be comprised of 6 main modules:   ? User Access Module  This module manages access levels and permissions for each class of user.,0
 The included access levels are: a.,0
 Administrator  b.,0
 Project Manager c.,0
 Analysts d.,0
 Guest ? Goal Specification and Management Module -This module supports goal management in the tool.,0
 ? Policy Management Module- This module supports policy management in the tool.,0
  ? Flesch Readability Index Module- This module supports requirements that calculate the Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.,0
 ? Scenario Specification and Management Module - This module supports scenario management in the tool.,0
 ? Requirements Specification Module- This module supports the requirements for a system.,0
 ? Legal Compliance ? Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF) module- This section defines the functional requirements that support RACAF.,0
3,0
 Module Requirements This section outlines the services to be provided by the tool.,0
" Each functional requirement includes: the purpose of the requirement, a brief description, the origin of the requirement and the priority of the requirement.",0
 These priorities have been set based on discussions with the stakeholders.,0
 SPRAT is a tool bench and will support several other tools.,0
 The software will be designed keeping all the layers in mind.,0
 But this summer the focus is on implementing the database and high and medium priority requirements for SPRAT and also implement RACAF.,0
    Priority Level Priority Description 1 High High priority requirements are critical and must be satisfied.,0
 The system may fail if the respective high priority requirements are not satisfied.,0
" Additionally, security related requirements are categorized as high priority.",0
" 2 Medium Medium priority requirements are important and desirable, but will not cause the system to fail if not satisfied.",0
 These requirements are needed by Qingfeng He for the development of RACAF.,0
 3 Low Low priority requirements are desirable but not necessary.,0
 These requirements are non-critical and can be postponed for implementation in later versions of the system.,0

The purpose of this requirements specification is to provide a repository for the high level requirements governing the design of the Clarus system.,0
 These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations and in meetings with potential users and participants.,0
 These requirements will be further refined and expanded as the project progresses and will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.,0
" The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.",0
"This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.",0
Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations.,0
"Provide a North American resource to collect, quality control, and make available surface transportation weather and road condition observations so that State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) can be more productive in maintaining safety and mobility on all roads.",0
Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.,0
Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather.,0
Surface transportation-based weather observations integrated with existing observation data will permit broader support for the enhancement and creation of models that make better predictions in the atmospheric boundary layer and near the Earth’s surface to support more accurate forecasts.,0
"The intent of the Clarus Initiative is to demonstrate how an open and integrated approach to observational data management can be used to collect, control the quality of, and consolidate surface transportation environmental data.",0
 The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems.,0
" This process offers the prospect of enhancing data coverage, improving the performance of meteorological support services, and providing guidance to owners of these data sources regarding the quality of their data and performance of their data collection systems.",0
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community.,0
" Surface transportation environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data, pavement data, and hydrologic (water level) data.",0
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.,0
"The first component is the development of the Clarus system – a network for sharing, quality controlling, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.",0
The second component is the development of tools (such as decision support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.,0
"The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.",0
Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses.,0
" Users having the most immediate contact with the Clarus system will include the owners and operators of the observing systems that are providing information to the Clarus system, as well as the users directly accessing the data contained within the Clarus system.",0

Some portions of the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref.,0
" 12) have been incorporated in this document, both for continuity of concept, and to help identify the basis for the high level requirements.",0
 Specific attributions of this content are only included where they enhance the context of the requirements.,0
The organization and content of this document is generally based on the IEEE standards for System Requirements Specifications (Ref.,0
 13).,0
" The requirements presented in this document represent the high level objectives, constraints, and desires for the Clarus system.",0
"Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability throughout the development process.",0
A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision described in a concept of operations.,0
 It does not state how it is to be accomplished.,0
 This document describes each requirement and the basis for inclusion of that requirement.,0
The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system.,0
Section 2 – General Description provides a general overview of the entire system.,0
 This section describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.,0
Section 3 – Specific Requirements contains the requirements developed from reference documentation and stakeholder communications.,0
 This section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system development process.,0
" The categories in this document are: Functional Requirements, Performance Requirements, and Organizational Requirements.",0
This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.,0
" This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.",0
 That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref.,0
" 12), from which much of the description in this section was derived.",0
 Descriptions of specific terms and acronyms used in this section may be found in Appendix A.,0
The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a “network of networks” — much like the Internet — for surface transportation environmental data.,0
" While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.",0
 Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.,0
Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.,0
" First, the participant will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus.",0
" Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.",0
" The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose.",0
" This concept of autonomous data sharing is comparable to the World Wide Web layer of the Internet, where organizations can publish information on web pages, or browse and download information published by other organizations on the web.",0
" Ownership of the data is retained by the organization that provided the data to Clarus, and the provider organization can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the Clarus program.",0
0,0
0,0
0,0
0,0
"The principal interfaces that will be critical to Clarus are the interface between Clarus and the participating collectors, and the interface between Clarus and the participating service providers.",0
" While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.",0
While the participants want to access the network through “a one-stop internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations” (Ref.,0
" 12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.",0
 Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a “one-stop” portal.,0
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.,0
" While some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality control function and the publication function, there is a clear recognition that as the data age, they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers.",0
 This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.,0
" Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.",0
"The Clarus system will collect data from contributing members, organize and qualify the data, and then publish the data for use by service providers and other members of the network.",0
 These basic processes are shown in Figure 2 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.,0
" The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between them.",0
" For example, a “Collector” administers a “Sensor”, collects “Observation Data”, provides “Sensor Metadata”, and receives “Quality Feedback”.",0
"The volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very large, which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can effectively gather, organize, and disseminate the data.",0
 The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.,1
Determining data types will be a significant challenge.,0
 Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.,0
"While there are many types of environmental data that could be collected, the Clarus emphasis on surface weather and transportation puts the focus on those weather elements that have a direct bearing on surface transportation systems.",0
 These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.,0
 8) and summarized in Table 1.,0
"There are basic temporal limits for the data collection, quality control, processing, and publication of the environmental data.",0
 There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements.,0
 The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture.,0
 These data time horizons are illustrated in Figure 3.,0
The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as a result of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation of the system to collect the data.,0
 The Clarus component includes the time required to communicate data from the Autonomous Layer to the Clarus system import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage structures.,0
" Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the required human- and machine-based product generation.",0
 The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.,0
 The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.,0
Average Elapsed Time is the estimated time for the process within a given layer or layer sub-division to take place.,0
 The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.,0
Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.,0
Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience.,0
" Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.",0
"The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.",0
Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests.,0
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.,0
 The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.,0
 From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.,0
" 5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) (Ref.",0
" 6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref.",0
" 7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user’s interface or interaction with Clarus data.",0
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.,0
 This is illustrated in Figure 4.,0
"The Autonomous Layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather and transportation data to make plans, decisions, and/or take action based upon sensor data within their control.",0
" These data include observations collected by ESS, mobile data acquisition platforms, cameras, and other transportation-related measurement devices.",0
 The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.,0
The Clarus Layer lies between the Autonomous and Service Providers Layers and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection and management.,0
The Service Providers Layer is composed of both public and private entities that provide basic and value-added weather support services to support the weather information needs of the broader surface transportation community.,0
" These support services rely on Clarus data (raw and processed) combined with other environmental, road condition, or traffic information products to develop or provide road weather information and enhanced products.",0
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.,0
" The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.",0
 The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.,0
" In some instances, the Service Provider Customer Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the Autonomous Layer who receive quality control information on the data they originally provided to Clarus.",0
Figure 4 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.,0
" There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 3, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers.",0
The context diagram in Figure 5 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.,0
 The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.,0
 The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.,0
 These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer — the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.,0
 These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.,0
" This quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality control thresholds.",0
The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.,0
 These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.,0
" Additional Service Providers having direct access to Clarus data resources include research organizations, external agencies that may choose to archive Clarus data, and other related weather service providers.",0
"Federal, State, and Local Agencies – These are the transportation system and road weather information system (RWIS) operators and owners who directly provide the Clarus data.",0
 This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.,0
" These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.",0
" Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.",0
Transit – These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.,0
 This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.,0
Rail – These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.,0
" This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-induced specifics such as rail temperatures, frozen switches, and drifting snow.",0
Vehicle – Emerging technologies are developing that will encourage a greater level of data collection from vehicles for the purpose of understanding the nature of the transportation system state including the impacts of weather.,0
" As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.",0
Surface Transportation Weather Service Providers (STWSP) – These surface transportation weather service providers are the private and public weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus data with other available data to generate value-added products and services used by the surface transportation decision-makers at state and local transportation agencies.,0
Weather Service Providers – These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data.,0
" This group includes the efforts in public forecasting by NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS) along with private sector weather services and their value-added support to markets such as agriculture, power utilities, and construction.",0
"Research – This category incorporates federal, academic, and private sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and practice through the research of surface transportation weather.",0
Archives – This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.,0
" The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.",0
Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.,0
 Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.,0
"To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.",0
 An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.,0
 The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.,0
Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations.,0
" Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.",0
" To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system.",0
 The primary challenge here will be the trade-off between the desire for reliability and the cost of redundancies.,0
"While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.",0
" Since Clarus is not replacing any existing application, the system is not currently critical to any operation or transportation function; neither is it intended to support any “critical national security missions”.",0
"The system shall be “open,” using an architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.",0
" The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.",0
 Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.,0
The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.,0
" While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.",0
" Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.",0
"Several assumptions have been made about how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.",0
 Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.,0
" Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.",0
 Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces.,0
"Even though the system will check the data and apply quality flags, consumers of Clarus-provided data will need to understand that neither FHWA nor the contributing data providers will accept responsibility for the accuracy of any of the data.",0
" The particular limitations and conditions will be defined in data sharing agreements to be established with data providers, and disclaimer information will be made available to data consumers by whatever means the data are published.",0
"Several requirements deal with “regional” needs, without specifying regional boundaries.",0
 It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.,0
 It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.,0
" Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.",0
 Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.,0
"The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.",0
" Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo-reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation.",0
"The availability, format, and precision of time/date stamps could also present unusual problems for the data acquisition system, particularly if contributing systems cannot manage Daylight Savings Time (DST), span time zones, or span areas that do and do not participate in DST.",0
 Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).,0
"The base assumption regarding “database tools” is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.",0
 No special database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus project.,0
This section presents the high-level requirements for the Clarus system and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs and goals described by the Concept of Operations.,0
 These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system as a whole and do not attempt to allocate capabilities to specific modules or subsystems within Clarus.,0
 This approach limits the high-level requirements in this document to those that can be derived from a context diagram (Figure 6) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its interfaces.,0
 The types of requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.,0
" Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality control, development, and packaging of environmental data.",0
 Each interface to the Clarus system has its own requirements: on collection of data from providers as input; on the dissemination of data for output; on the controlling rules and constraints under which the system operates; and on the means (primarily data management) by which it works.,0
The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.,0
" The high-level requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently tied to specific components.",0
 Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.,0
 The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high-level requirements.,0
"In this section, the requirements are divided into the following categories.",0
Functional Requirements – Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.,0
" Identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.",0
"Functional Interface Requirements, which describe the functional interfaces to the Clarus system from information providers and consumers.",0
"Performance Requirements – Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the number of users, connections, and other performance related factors.",0
"Quality Requirements, which provide requirements which address the general quality, usability, extensibility, flexibility, and maintainability of the system.",0
"Organizational Requirements – Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.",0
Specifies any communications interfaces and protocols that should be supported.,0
"Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.",0
0,0
0,0
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.,0
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.,0
" It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.",0
" The functional requirements are broken into subsections by general functions, data functions, and interface functions.",0
"The general functional requirements apply to the system as a whole, without respect to specific functions or processes.",0
"The data requirements identify and describe the management of information to be acquired, processed, and disseminated.",0
The functional interface requirements describe the functional interfaces to the Clarus system from information providers and consumers.,0
"The requirements in this section specify static and dynamic capacity for the number of users, connections, and other performance related factors.",0
" The performance requirements are divided into subsections and are provided in the form of design constraints, quality requirements, and system performance requirements.",0
Design constraints apply existing rules or external conditions to the system.,0
" Examples of design constraints are communication standards, requirements for standardized hardware or software, and minimum needs for a system to be useful.",0
These quality requirements pertain directly to maintaining a high level of service quality.,0
System performance requirements specify quantitatively what the system must do and in what timeframe.,0
"Organizational requirements deal with policies regarding external parties involved with the system, personnel roles, training, and security needs.",0
"The following table provides definitions of terms, acronyms, and abbreviations to assist interpretation of this document.",0

1 Introduction  1.,0
1 Purpose  This document describes the requirements for the Triangulation Games software.,0
1,0
2 Document Conventions All the references in this document have been made by using running numeration.,0
" When you see a number between closures, example [1] this means that it refers to the first reference mentioned in the reference section at the end of this document.",0
"   There is a glossary at the end of the document, where the more uncommon terms are explained.",0
1,0
3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions The document is meant for the software project group and also for the client to specify what will be implemented in the Triangulation Games software.,0
1,0
"4 Project Scope Triangulation Games software is an application that makes it possible to play various different combinatorial games as solitaire, against the computers AI or with another player.",0
 The system also functions as a platform for defining new types of triangulation games.,1
   2 Overall Description  2.,0
1 Product Perspective Triangular Games is a stand-alone software application that is meant to realize games described in the article Games on Triangulations [1].,0
2,0
"2 Product Features The software makes it possible to play multiple triangulation games (see [1], for more information on triangular games).",0
" The games may be played alone or against another person, depending on the type of game.",0
 A graphical user interface will be shown to the user.,0
 This user interface is mainly mouse controlled but may also be used with a keyboard as well.,0
"    By default, the system will be able to implement three different games, namely constructing, transforming and marking.",0
 New games may be added to the software easily without the need to modify the code of the original application.,0
 These added games will be automatically selectable through the applications graphical user interface.,0
2,0
3 User Classes and Characteristics The main user class is player.,0
 This is the most important user class and the user interface design will be geared towards serving the player.,0
" The software is however designed mostly for research oriented people coming from areas such as mathematics, social sciences and computer sciences.",0
"   Although all research people have an academic background, the technical level of experience may vary greatly.",0
 This means that no assumptions about highly experienced users can be made.,0
 The user interface will be designed to serve the needs of inexperienced players.,0
"  Since adding new games to the software will also be possible, one user class is the game developer.",0
 People from this user class will have experience in playing the games and the scientific background behind creating new games.,0
 This user class is not as important as the player class and users of this class are mostly interested in the ease of defining new games.,0
2,0
4 Operating Environment The software will be implemented using the Java-platform.,0
 This makes it possible to run the application on multiple different environments without any modification to the code.,0
" The software requires a mouse or a keyboard, a graphical user environment (X window system, Windows, Mac, etc.",1
"), and Java-runtime environment (version 1.",0
4 or later)[2].,0
2,0
"5 Design and Implementation Constraints The client has requested the use of the Java environment, so the platform has been chosen before design.",0
" Because of the cross-platform requirement, the software cannot be dependent on platform-specific libraries.",1
  The software should run well on any computer which has Java 2 (version 1.,1
4 or later) Runtime Environment (JRE)[3] installed.,0
" Installation should be easy, so no external databases should be required.",1
2,0
6 User Documentation Documentation about how to define new games will be provided to make it possible for non-developers to create new games for the system.,0
" There are going to be two end user documentations:  - User manual, for end users.",0
 It will describe how to use the system for playing.,0
" - Maintenance manual, for end users and new developers.",0
 It will describe how to specify new games for the system.,0
" It will also contain the design documents and interfaces of the system, as well as the source code.",0
" If necessary, it will describe also how to implement a plug-in (such as an AI) for the system.",0
2,0
7 Assumptions and Dependencies This software will be released under the GPL-license.,0

 Introduction 1.,0
1 Purpose  The USDA and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have supported hydrologic research since the 1930's and many of the research watersheds are still operational.,0
"  However, data have been managed and made available independently at each research location, greatly reducing the accessibility and utility of these data for policy-relevant, multi-site analyses.",0
"  The ARS is developing and implementing a data system to organize, document, manipulate and compile water, soil, management, and economic data for assessment of conservation practices.",0
" While primary responsibility for data will continue to reside at individual watersheds, the new data system will provide one-point access to data from the sites in well-documented, and standardized formats.",0
"  The purpose of this document is to describe the technical and operation requirements that meet the needs of the CEAP Watershed Assessment Studies, as well as additional needs of researchers at the watershed sites and diverse outside users, in adequate detail to provide the basis for the system design.",0
  The system will be called STEWARDS: Sustaining the Earth's Watersheds  Agricultural Research Data System.,0
1,0
"2 About this Document and its Readers The system requirements specification document describes what the system is to do, and how the system will perform each function.",0
 The audiences for this document include the system developers and the users.,0
  The system developer uses this document as the authority on designing and building system capabilities.,0
  The users review the document to ensure the documentation completely and accurately describes the intended functionality.,0
   This version  version 1.,0
0 - provides general descriptions of the system.,0
  The system developer should review the document to ensure there is adequate information for defining an initial design of the system.,0
"  The users should review the document to affirm the features described are needed, to clarify features, and to identify additional features needed within the system.",0
    The next version  version 2.,0
0  will be the result of more detailed requirements analysis.,0
  When version 2.,0
"0 is written, the system developer and users will be asked to review this document.",0
 The document is structured to follow IEEE 830-1998 standards for recording system requirements.,0
1,0
"3 Project Scope As part of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), twelve ARS Benchmark Watersheds will support watershed-scale assessment of environmental effects of USDA conservation program implementation.",0
" The ARS Benchmark Watersheds represent primarily rainfed cropland, although some of the watersheds also contain irrigated cropland, grazingland, wetlands, and confined animal feeding operations.",0
 Three additional ARS watersheds may be added in the future to represent additional land uses.,0
" Conservation practices to be emphasized will include NRCS CORE 4 practices for croplands (conservation buffers, nutrient management, pest management, and tillage management), drainage management systems, and manure management practices.",0
" Environmental effects and benefits will be estimated primarily for water and soil resources, with some assessment of wildlife habitat and air quality benefits in some watersheds.",0
"System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 2  The goal for the watershed-scale research is to provide detailed assessments of conservation practices and programs in a selected watershed, provide a framework for improving the performance of the national assessment models, and support coordinated research on the effects of conservation practices across a range of resource characteristics (such as climate, terrain, land use, and soils).",0
"  The basic requirement for STEWARDS is to deliver consistent high quality data in support of the CEAP watershed-scale assessment from a one-stop data portal to the CEAP clients and, in time, the public at large.",1
" The data system consists two main parts -- a central database management system for the storage and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the data.",0
 The data stored in the database can be viewed and downloaded using graphical and tabular interface tools.,0
"   The data system will serve as a repository where diverse end-users can access, search, analyze, visualize, and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.",1
"  Types of data will be diverse, including biophysical data (i.",0
e.,0
", point-based in time and/or space, spatially variable data, time series), data about land use, management, and conservation practices; and economic data.",0
"    Where applicable, data from the NRCS, Economics Research Service (ERS) Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators database, other ERS sources of data on costs of conservation practices, and land use and management data of NASS or other agencies will be utilized.",0
  The intention of the team is that ARS researchers at watershed locations retain primary responsibility for data collection and management.,0
  Sites may chose to retain existing data management protocols or change location protocols to those of STEWARDS.,0
"  However, STEWARDS must have the capability to translate data from location-specific formats into the standardized STEWARDS formats.",1
  Data on STEWARDS will not be available to the public in real time.,1
  Access to real-time data will remain at the discretion of each location research team.,0
"  Instead, annual or more frequent updates from location databases to STEWARDS will be made by the watersheds staffs after the locations have completed their quality assurance procedures.",0

"  UCC-2: Data operations manager: Staff, probably at OCIO, responsible for data archiving and maintenance, requiring read/write/modify privileges to all data in the system.",0
  This includes the role commonly thought of as a Database Administrator (DBA).,0
  UCC-3: Watershed uploaders: Staff in the watersheds who have responsibility to upload local data requiring write access to space allocated to their specific watershed.,0
"  UCC-4: ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes.",0
" These would likely be conversant with the general characteristics of the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating views of the data using database tools such as envisioned for this database system.",0
 These users will need user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in CEAP.,0
"  UCC-5: Research users: Non-ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes.",0
" These would have similar characteristics and needs as ARS users, but because of the agency-level confidentiality issues, could not access the password-protected sensitive data.",0
"   UCC-6: Public users: Eventual release of the database system to the general public will add university and agency researchers who would appear similar in training to the primary users, but also would add clients with the entire range of training and interests.",0
 These users would have access to the public data without need for authentication.,0
2,0
"4 Operating Environment  The rule for selecting hardware and software is that the components/application must be functionally efficient, capable of interfacing with other software, and easy to maintain.",0
  OE-1: The System shall operate with the following Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.,1
0 and 6.,0
"0, Netscape Communicator version 4.",0

System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 5 2.,0
5 Design and Implementation Constraints The goal of the web application is to be platform independent on the client side wherever possible.,0
"  Therefore, the web applications will be implemented to run on the server side as much as possible.",0
" Also, it is required to test the application using different platforms, connection speeds, screen settings, colors/graphics, and browsers.",1
   CO-1: Portability: The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.,0
   CO-2: Database Design: The database structure should be as complete as possible during the design stage but there should be a room for modification without a large overhaul during later phases.,1
  CO-3: Data uploading and management will likely be done as infrequently as once a year.,0
  This fact greatly limits the complexity of the user interface and the learning curve needed for completing this task.,0
  CO-4: The system shall use the current corporate standard Microsoft SQL Server database engine.,1
"  CO-5: The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security policies applicable.",1
"   CO-6: As part of standard operating procedures, a testing plan will be documented during the Design phase.",1
" The testing plan will be based on user roles, modules or use cases, required tasks and expected outcomes.",0
2,0
"6 User Documentation User documentation will consist of the several components usually expected of a modern web-based software application, including a tutorial, help pages, FAQs with an online request form, and a complete users manual.",0
"  UD-1: A tutorial will provide a quick start, a walk-thru of major system features, and further reference source for the complete system features.",0
  UD-2: An online hierarchical and cross-linked help system in HTML will describe and illustrate all system functions.,0
  UD-3:  An online form will enable users to request help.,1
 Frequently asked questions will be screened for the FAQ pages.,1
  UD-4: The user's guide (or user manual) will contain sufficient information and instructions required to access and use the data system.,1

System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 6 2.,0
"7 Assumptions and Dependencies It is anticipated that each watershed location will provide human and fiscal resources required to prepare metadata files, data files, work with the data team on initial import of data, perform subsequent data uploads, and provide site-specific support to users of the system.",0
"  If a location has inadequate resources, the minimal data required for CEAP analyses will be identified and the data team will provide additional support to that location.",0
  This may result in a locations data coming into the system later than scheduled.,0
  Team leaders anticipate availability of the operational platform at the ARS OCIO level.,0
"  Pilot and, as a contingency, operational data systems may be developed and maintained at El Reno or other research locations.",0
  It is anticipated that funding from NRCS will partially support this activity through FY07.,0
"  If that funding were not available or insufficient in future years, base funds at the locations and/or discretionary funds from the Area and Headquarters funds would support the activity but the timelines would be adjusted.",0
    Help desk funding will be determined from staffing needs identified during the design phase and a proposal will then be made to NPS.,0

System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 9 3.,0
"3 Data Dissemination To make data electronically available any place and any time through a web server-client service, the web service will be platform independent as much as possible.",0
" Where there is an exception, the software/hardware requirement should be specified for a particular application.",0
"  Users whose computing environment precludes downloading the data via the internet will have the opportunity to acquire data, reports, model results and other STEWARDS information via alternative media.",1
3,0
4 Hardware requirements HR-1:     Data Storage HR-1.,0
1: Online Storage - The system needs to be able to store hundreds of megabytes of data on demand.,1
  The potential for needing Gigabytes of data storage capacity is also in the realm of possibilities.,1
  Further requirements gathering is needed to get real-world estimates of such data storage needs.,0
  HR-1.,0
2: Near-line Storage  All User and Application data as well as software installation and configuration files must be fully backed up week-nightly.,1

3,0
6 Data migration to and retrieval from STEWARDS Data will be subject to quality assurance prior to either initial or recurring uploading to STEWARDS.,1
 Initial population of STEWARDS will require that transition filters be developed jointly between the STEWARDS team and the individual watersheds.,1
" These filters will provide the same function for recurring, probably annual, uploads.",1
3,0
6,0
1 Quality Assurance  Local watershed staff will be responsible for performing necessary quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures prior to data being uploaded to the STEWARDS database.,0
  Measurement methods and QA/QC procedures established by the CEAP Quality Assurance Team will be used by local data producers and recorded in the data provided to STEWARDS.,0
  The purpose of quality assurance is intended to provide added assurance of data integrity.,0
 Quality assurance checking will be carried out at two different levels  local site level and central site level.,1
" First, the guidelines for quality assurance, including parameter-specific ranges, threshold values, quality flags etc.",0
", will be determined.",0
 Quality assurance checking at the local sites may be performed before or during the standard exchange file conversion phase.,0
" A general quality assurance checking, not as specific as at the local sites, will be carried out during the data uploading stage.",0
" Note that a) the primary responsibility for data quality assurance rests with the individual sites and b) the quality assurance ranges, criteria, etc.",0
", used here should be consistent with the quality assurance information specified in metadata (and may be a component of  the data dictionary).",0
3,0
6,0
2 Populating data   Basic information regarding individual watersheds will be made available to STEWARDS by local watershed sites.,0
"  Basic information may include spatial data in a GIS-compatible format; descriptive data about stations, instruments, methods, or procedures; reports; modeling results; and other data.",0
  Data will be reformatted to be compatible with the STEWARDS data schema and CEAP modeling requirements.,1
  Watershed data to be used in modeling that does not conform to model requirements will be processed in STEWARDS for inclusion in the STEWARDS databases.,0
"  As part of the initial population of the database, time-series data (measurement data, annual land use information, weather/climate data) that has been collected by local watershed staff will be processed through local and CEAP QA/QC procedures and uploaded to the STEWARDS database by watershed staff per obligations to CEAP Objective 1.",0
System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 11 Protocols for data imports from local sites via input files with different formats will be developed and implemented jointly between the STEWARDS team and the local watersheds.,0
 The standard exchange file format will have been jointly determined first.,0
 A single import filter will be written to parse the standard formatted (e.,0
g.,0
 tab-delimited) files from the local watershed sites.,0
" In this manner, all the data files from the local sites will have consistent formats when they are stored in the central site.",0
 The filter developed for the intial population of the database will be available for use in later periodic uploads.,0
3,0
6,0
"3 Updating Data  Time-series data (measurement data, annual land use information, weather/climate data) and other data (spatial data, metadata) will be collected by local watershed staff, processed through local and CEAP QA/QC procedures, and uploaded to the STEWARDS database on an annual basis using the filter developed during the initial population of the database.",1
 Requests will initiate from the central system per schedule negotiated with individual watersheds.,1
 Compliance by watershed staff is understood to be expected per obligations under CEAP watershed project plans revised to accommodate the CEAP project plan objective 1.,0
3,0
6,0
"4 Data derivation/aggregation   The central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds, sub-watersheds on a station-by-station basis, or a collection of stations if the entire dataset is desired.",0
" Multiple levels of data aggregation of time-series data (daily, monthly, or yearly) will be supported.",0
" A great flexibility of export data should be also available in terms of data volume (the number of data entity and time coverage) and output format [for example, for tabular data  comma separated values (csv) or database format (dbf); for spatial data  shape files (shp) or ascii grid files (grd);  for reports  Adobe page definition format (pdf)].",1
4,0
 External Interface Requirements 4.,0
"1 User Interfaces The user interface will be simple and consistent, using terminology commonly understood by the intended users of the system.",1
"  The system will have a simple interface, consistent with industry standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users.",1
  The STEWARDS team will evaluate the user interface of similar systems and apply appropriately.,1
  For additional details see Appendix E.,0
" User testing will be used to ensure the user interface is clear (simple, commonly understood vocabulary, intuitive to use without training), complete (users can perform all functions from the interface), and consistent (buttons and wording are the same throughout the system).",0
4,0
2 Hardware Interfaces No extra hardware interfaces are needed.,0
"  The system will use the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD.",1
" This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools.",0
"  This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available.",1
System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 12 4.,0
3 Software Interfaces The system will use the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO.,1
"  This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C#, MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server.",0
4,0
4 Communications Interfaces The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO.,1
"  This includes, but is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communication with the web browser and the web server and TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol.",0
5,0
 Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.,0
1 Performance Requirements PR-1: Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases.,1
 Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less.,1
" Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.",1
" If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met.",1
" In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.",0
    PR-2: Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.,1
5,0
2 Safety Requirements Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost.,1
" Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.",1
5,0
"3 Security Requirements STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consistent with ARS OCIO practices, in compliance with agency, Dept and Govt regulations.",1
  STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components.,1
"  They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",0
"  SCR-1: Authentication STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication.",1
 Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are.,0
  This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.,0
  This is primarily done through userids and passwords.,0
System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 13 Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately.,0
  STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.,1
3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate.,0
   Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.,1
  SCR-3: Data Integrity The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product.,1
  Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system.,0
"  Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.",0
"  The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.",1
  SCR-4: Availability The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability.,0
"  The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week).",1
"  For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components.",1
  Intentional denial of service attacks is not foreseen as a significant concern.,0
5,0
4 Software Quality Attributes SQ-1:  Portability This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.,0
   SQ-2:  Adaptability Implementation of the application software/code and design of database structure should be flexible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.,1
   SQ-3:  Availability Availability is defined here to mean the ability to use the system during its intended period of operation as defined in SCR-4 above.,0

" The term ""AGNPS"" now refers to the system of modeling components instead of the single-event AGNPS, which was discontinued in the mid-1990's.",0
 These enhancements have been included to improve the capability of the program and to automate many of the input data preparation steps needed for use with large watershed systems.,0
  New to AnnAGNPS Version 3.,0
42 are many minor enhancements to algorithms and more output options.,0
 The AGNPS Arcview interface has been better integrated with the components needed to develop AnnAGNPS datasets.,0
" The capabilities of RUSLE, used by USDA-NRCS to evaluate the degree of erosion on agricultural fields and to guide development of conservation plans to control erosion, have been incorporated into AnnAGNPS.",0
  This provides a watershed scale aspect to conservation planning.,0

System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 18 Appendix F: System Design  System Design Goals:  The purpose of system design is to translate the system requirements into more technical specifications.,0
" Through a user case survey and a logical analysis of users expectations and system functionalities, the system components for STEWARDS are identified (Fig.",0
 F1).,0
 System design provides a detailed description for each identified component and produces a physical data system design (with documentation) that allow the system developers to construct each component (layer) accordingly.,0
"  At the end of the system design phase, hardware, software tools and skill requirements, and other resources will be identified and a system developer team/plan will be drawn.",0
" After that, the construction phase will begins (Task flow of can be seen in  Fig.",0
 H1 in Appendix H).,0
"  System Design Methodology:  The system design process can be divided into three main phases: conceptual system design, logical system design, and physical system design.",0
" In this appendix, only conceptual system design and logical system design for STEWARDS are documented.",0
 Physical system design (how the logical structure of  STEWARDS will be implemented) is still in a planning stage and will be described later.,0
" Physical design, which involves producing a description of the implementation of logical system design, will be tailored to STEWARDS and all physical considerations (including tools/software such as Microsoft SQL server, Oracle SQL server etc.",0
) will be specific to STEWARDS.,0
  Conceptual System Design: Build a conceptual data system for STEWARDS  As depicted in the conceptual model of STEWARDS (Fig.,0
" F12), the task underway in this phase is to define/identify system components such as:  1.",0
" hardware infrastructure component, 2.",0
" data/database component (metadata standards, measurement data),  3.",0
" interface/application component (metadata search, measurement data search, data access, visualization, data downloads, and their relationships), and  4.",0
 data uploading tool component.,0
   The database design and interface/application design parallel each other within the system development process.,0
 The total number of system components will depend on the level of detail.,0
" For example, the data component of STEWARDS can be further identified as watershed climate, image, soils, management, pollutant source,  hydrology, socio-economic, water quality data,  data search, data downloads etc (Fig.",0
 F2).,0
 Description for hardware infrastructure design will be provided separately.,0
"  Logical System Design: Build and validate the logical data system for STEWARDS  During the logical system design phase, a logical data system (all system components and their relationships) will be constructed and validated.",0
" In other words, the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams for measurement data and user graphic interfaces (UGIs) to connect all components will be developed.",0
"  For example,  an entity-relationship diagram for measured climate data at South Fork watershed, Iowa, is given in Fig.",0
 F3.,0
" Climate is an entity (subject) and it becomes a table (Topic(Variable)_Table which holds variables such as min_temperature, max_temperature, etc.",0
) in the database.,0
System Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 19 yellow background in Fig.,0
 F3).,0
 Fig.,0
 F3 also shows the relationships between tables.,0
"  The tables  STEWARDS_Units_lookup_Table, [WS]_Topic_Table, and [WS]_Site_ID_Table are supporting data tables to the [WS]_Climate_Daily table.",0
 The latter is the basic data table where climate data are stored.,0
 Note that the characteristics (topic) of  a theme (e.,0
g.,0
 climate)  in Fig.,0
" F3 become the fields (min_temperature, max_temperature, etc.",0
).,0
 The data descriptors for the basic data table and supporting tables are shown in Tables F1 and  F2 respectively.,0
   A generalized data flow and table relationship is given in Fig.,0
 F4.,0
  Fig.,0
 F5.,0
 is a diagram in which the data flow and relationship of system components were identified.,0
 It provides a skeleton of system interface design.,0
" Three major system application components are identified: overview/summary, system search, and data access/visualization/downloads.",0
"  For next level of detail, the system component diagram for access login component, system/summary system component, metadata search component, site summary search, component, watershed specific search component, topic search component, site specific search component, pre-existing search component, characterizing watershed GIS component,  and data access/visualization component are given in Figs.",0
 F6 to F15.,0
 The descriptions for these higher level system components are given in another document (Software module design documentation_v2-2.,0
doc at The USDA-ARS ARSNET Team 1 Sharepoint site).,0
  Data Importing/Translation:  The tasks for importing data from the local sites into the centralized site required the following considerations.,0
1,0
 Assumptions: a.,0
" Metadata will be compliant at time of production in the local sites  no translation required, just the upload.",0
 b.,0
" Therefore, translating empirical data is the only need.",0
 c.,0
 Translation will be local site specific and done there.,0
 d.,0
 A thesaurus of columns and allowed parameter ids (identification IDs) will be developed either internal or external to the translation team before acting on the below.,0
2,0
 There are three types of empirical data we will need to address.,0
 a.,0
 Time series data (Type 1 data) with columns for different data collected at the same time.,0
 Example is flat table of weather data.,0
  A generalized data structure for this type of data is given in Fig.,0
 I1 in Appendix I.,0
 b.,0
" Time series data (Type 2 data), usually more sparse than the above, with an id field that explains what the parameter field contains.",0
 Example is water quality data.,0

   Software Requirements Specification  1 Introduction 1.,0
1 Purpose The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a collection and organization of all the requirements surrounding a project.,0
"  As the Vision Document was a broad statement of user needs, goals and objectives, and features of the system, the SRS begins the detailing of those needs and features, and how they are going to be implemented in the solution.",0
"  The SRS is a collection, or package, of artifacts that describe the complete external behavior of the system (i.",0
e.,0
", what the system has to do to deliver those features).",0
"  Following the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and its iterative nature, the SRS is not a frozen document, but rather a living artifact.",0
  It has a number of uses as the developer begins the implementation efforts.,0
  It serves as a basis for communication between all parties (i.,0
e.,0
", between the developers themselves, between the developers and the stakeholders).",0
  The SRS will also serve as input to software testing and quality assurance checks.,0
"  During testing, Test Cases will be created to ensure that the developed system does indeed fulfill the requirements outlined in the SRS.",0
1,0
"2 Overview The Water Use Tracking (WUT) Systems SRS, as outlined above, is a collection of artifacts that have been developed separately during the Implementation Phase of the project.",0
  This packaging of artifacts will include information from the following documents:  Vision Document  Requirements Workshops Summaries  Requirement Traceability Matrix  Use Case Model and Use Cases  Supplementary Specification  This SRS outlines the process the WUT Project Development Team followed to gather the requirements for the project.,0
"  This document will also describe how the requirement statements gathered from the stakeholders make their way into use case documents and, eventually, into features of the system.",0
"   2 Project Scope The vision of the Water Use Tracking (WUT) System, as captured during the Executive Stakeholders Workshop, defines the system as:  A GIS-based system that allows District employees and external customers to spatially and temporally track and analyze key Regulatory and Resource Management data.",0
  This system will support Southwest Florida Water Management Districts (SWFWMD) activities defined in the Southern Water Use Caution Area (SWUCA) Management Plan and to validate and assess the results of the SWUCA II Rules.,1
"  Although this system is being built to support the efforts within the SWUCA, it will support the same functionality for anywhere within the District.",1
2,0
"1  Problem Statement Rules are in the process of being implemented in support of the SWUCA Recovery Strategy that has no current, automated way of being validated or assessed in their fulfillment of the needs of the plan.",0
  One problem is no formal or consistent system exists at the District (manual or automated) to comprehensively track and analyze geographic and temporal trends in permitted and actual water uses within the SWUCA.,0
"  Currently, tracking of spatial and temporal trends in permitted and actual water uses is done using manual and semi-automated methodologies by a number of groups in the District.",0
"    Examples of current work include monthly summary reports of permitted pumpage developed by the Technical Services Department, annual water use estimates developed by the Conservation Projects Department, and ad hoc maps of permitted pumpage developed by the Mapping and GIS Section (MGIS).",0
"  This approach is staff time intensive, and since data sources and methodologies vary between different groups conducting these analyses, it may lead to inconsistent or apparently conflicting results.",0
  This is further complicated by the fact that current database management systems and data collection activities were not specifically designed to support these types of activities.,0
  The result is that the current system does not adequately support the types of analyses required for successful implementation of the SWUCA Management Plan.,0
2,0
2 Product Position Statement The WUT Project will provide software for several different customer types.,1
"  As outlined in the SWUCA Permitted Water Use Tracking Application  Feasibility Study, the primary groups who will be using the system are:  Water Use Permit (WUP) Evaluators  The system will assist in the WUP review process.",1
"  Technical Services Staff  The system will be used to track and analyze long-term trends in permitted and actual water use and to assist in identifying underlying causes for these trends (land use change, socio-economic conditions, environmental factors, etc.",1
).,0
"  It will also provide tools that can be used to aggregate permitted and actual pumpage over specified geographic areas (model grid cells, counties, Most Impacted Area (MIA), watershed, etc.",1
).,0
   Records and Data Staff  The system will provide tools to assist in the quality control/quality assurance of WUP data.,1
  Resource Conservation and Development Department  The system will provide information that can be used to assist in the calibration of ground water models.,1
  The system will also provide information on WUPs that can support the establishment and monitoring of Minimum Flows and Levels.,1
"  In addition, the system will provide information that assists in the development of estimated water use  Planning Department  The system will provide tools to assist in studies analyzing impacts of changing demographics and economic conditions on water use within the SWUCA.",1
  Executive Staff/Governing Board  The system will provide standard reports that are published as hardcopy or web-accessible documents.,1
"  Web accessible maps and documents could be interactive, allow users to zoom, pan, and query areas of interest.",1
"  External Customers  External customers potentially include local governments, the media, and the general public.",0
"  Standard interactive map interfaces will provide information in a consistent, low maintenance environment.",1
  Other Users  This system is in line with the objectives of the CWM Information Technology initiative presented to the Governing Board in June 2002.,1
  It will provide improved access to WUP data for all District staff.,1

"1 Hardware/Software Environment The proposed system does not appear to require any significant hardware or software resources beyond that which currently exists, or is planned for implementation, at the District.",0
2,0
4,0
1,0
1 IBM DB2 Data Server The IBM DB2 data server was upgraded in January 2003 and it is anticipated that it has sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.,0
  It is likewise anticipated that the current DB2 database software configuration will support the proposed system.,0
2,0
4,0
1,0
2 HP-UX ArcSDE/Oracle Data Server The District is currently retiring the obsolete HP Tru-64 computer system and replacing it with an HP-UX system.,0
  It is anticipated that when this upgrade is completed in fiscal year (FY) 2004 that the system will have sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.,0
"  It is likewise anticipated that when the upgrade is completed, current ArcSDE/Oracle database system configuration will support the proposed system.",0
2,0
4,0
1,0
3 Communications/Data Network The primary impact of this system on the network will occur during the transfer of data between the IBM and HP-UX systems.,1
"  Since this transfer will occur only during non-business hours, it is not anticipated that it will have a significant impact on the current network.",0
2,0
4,0
1,0
4 Web/ArcIMS Servers The current Web/ArcIMS Server environment will be expanded in FY 2004 to support of CWM activities and it is anticipated that it will have sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.,1
"  In the event that these servers are not adequate, they are relatively inexpensive to upgrade.",0
2,0
4,0
1,0
5 Desktop Workstations It is anticipated that this system will operate within the ArcGIS ArcView and ArcIMS web browser environment that is currently implemented at the District.,1
2,0
"5 Product Perspective The system will require a combination of permitting, geographic, and water resource data derived from the following sources.",1
2,0
5,0
1 WUP Data The data source for WUPs is the Regulatory Database (RDB).,1
  This database is implemented in the IBM DB2 environment on the District's IBM mainframe data server located in the Tampa Data Center.,1
  The Records and Data Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of the data in the RDB.,1
"  The Information Resources Department (IRD) is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the RDB.",1
2,0
5,0
2 Geographic Data The data source for geographic data is the GIS.,1
  This database is implemented in the ArcSDE/Oracle environment on the District's HP-UX data server located in the Brooksville computer room.,0
  The Mapping and GIS Section (MGIS) is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of most of the data in the GIS.,0
"  The Land Resources, Operations, and Records and Data Departments maintain specialized datasets within the GIS.",0
"  IRD and MGIS are jointly responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the GIS.",0
2,0
5,0
"3 Water Resource Data It is anticipated that data on ground and surface water levels, water quality, stream flows, and climatological trends will be used in this system.",1
  The source for these data is the Water Management Database (WMDB).,0
  This database is implemented in the IBM DB2 environment on the District's IBM mainframe data server located in the Tampa Data Center.,0
  The Operations Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of the water levels/flows and meteorological data in the RDB.,0
"  Water quality data stored in the WMDB are collected by multiple departments, processed by the District's laboratory, and loaded into the WMDB.",0
"  It is important to note that while almost all water level information collected by the District is entered into the WMDB, loading of water quality data is less common.",0
"  The WMDB, therefore, does not provide a comprehensive collection of water quality data.",0
" The Information Resources Department (IRD) is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the WMDB.",0
2,0
5,0
"4 GIS/RDB/WMDB Data Integration The proposed system will require the integration of data in the GIS, RDB, and WMDB.",1
  Data in these systems are logically linked using a common identifier known as the Universal ID (UID).,1
  Each WUP withdrawal point and data collection site is assigned a UID.,1
"  UIDs are unique for physical objects such as wells, rain gauges, and stream gauges.",1
  Unique UIDs are also assigned to surface water quality sample sites.,1
"  In cases where a well is both associated with a WUP and also serves as a data collection site, it is assigned a single UID that provides linkages to data stored in both the RDB and WMDB.",1
"  In the GIS, the UID is associated with a physical location and, therefore, can be represented within a data layer representing WUPs, stream gauges, or rainfall stations.",1
  Data are physically transferred from the DB2-based WMDB and RDB to the ArcSDE/Oracle based GIS using the Transformation Server software.,1
  This software provides tools for moving data between databases in their entirety or as selected subsets.,1
"  While this transfer is currently only done from the WMDB/RDB to the GIS, it is technically possible to transfer data in the other direction.",1
2,0
"6 Assumptions and Dependencies Requirements have surfaced that require data that is currently not available, either not collected or not stored in one of the databases (e.",1
g.,0
", relocated quantities, lapsed quantities, etc.",0
).,0
"  It is assumed that the needed changes, to collect and store the data, will be made within the current application and database.",1
   is assumed this would not be within the scope of this project.,0
"  However, if the required changes cannot be completed to the current systems in a timely manner, the WUT System will need to implement these requirements within the new application.",1
  It is also assumed that the current databases mentioned above are still available in their current form during the development of the WUT System.,0
"  The WUT System will be dependent on the data stored in the WUP, WMDB, GIS, and RDB databases.",1
  Changes to the current systems would need to be done in collaboration with the WUT Project Development Team.,0
  Communication between the responsible parties is key in the success of the development of this system.,0
  One requirement for the WUT System is that it will be developed with the hardware and software architecture currently in place at the District.,1
  Changes to the current architecture requirements could have a negative impact on the development of this system and cause delays in the release of the system.,0
2,0
7 Needs The following is a list of needs that were captured in the SWUCA Permitted Water Use Tracking Application  Feasibility Study.,0
  These needs and the requirements gathered at the Requirements Workshops will be consolidated and presented to the Stakeholders at the Requirements Summary Workshop for discussion and prioritization.,0
"   Needs:  Depict geographic and temporal trends in permitted and/or actual pumpage within the SWUCA  ""Cradle to grave"" tracking and analysis of individual ground and surface water withdrawal points  Identification of sources for withdrawal points (surface versus ground, aquifer, status, alternative sources, etc.",0
)  Monitoring changes in permitted and actual pumping  Tracking changes in predominant use types  Tracking changes in permit ownership  Identifying withdrawal points with lapsed permitted quantities.,0
"  As used here, lapsed quantities refer to any reductions in permitted pumpage for a particular well.",0
"  These may be the result of expiration of a permit, purchase of land that leads to retiring of a WUP, changes in predominant use type, plugging of well, or any other event that leads to a reduction in the permitted withdrawal from that point.",0
2,0
8 Other Product Requirements It is anticipated that the proposed system will be developed within the current software development environment used at the District.,1
"  The following is the current systems and their associated development environments:  System Development Environment   WMDB, RDB JCL, SQL, J2EE, COBOL SDE/Oracle PL/SQL, Visual Studio .",0
"NET, ArcObjects ArcIMS Visual Studio .",0
"NET, ArcIMS ArcObjects ArcGIS ArcView Visual Studio .",0
"NET, SQL, ArcObjects   3 Requirements Gathering Process By following the RUP process, the WUT Project Development Team is executing a software development approach that is iterative, architecture-centric, and use-case driven.",0
  Use cases are a very important artifact of the initial phase of the project.,0
"  The RUP outlines a process of how the development team goes from a vision of the system to be built, to specific requirements extracted from stakeholders, and, finally, to a use case model and use cases.",0
3,0
1 Requirement Workshops and Summaries Requirement workshops were held in the initial weeks of the project to gather the users requirements to the system.,0
"  The stakeholders for the project are categorized into four categories:  Executive Staff, Technical Staff, Science Business Staff, and Regulatory Staff.",0
  Workshops were held for each of these groups with follow-up one-on-one interviews to clarify or refine requirements.,0
  The agenda for each of these workshops was tailored to each of these groups.,0
"  For example, the Executive Staff meeting is more focused on the vision of the project.",0
  The Technical Staff meeting is more focused on the technical requirements of the project.,0
"  The remaining two groups, mostly made up of the power-users of the system, concentrated on the actual requirements of the system.",0
  An additional workshop was held to outline specific requirements needed for the system to support the SWUCA Recovery Plan.,0
  A summary was produced for each of the workshops and distributed to the participants for review.,0
  Feedback was received through the review process and the summaries were updated to reflect these comments.,0
3,0
2 Requirements Traceability Matrix All the requirements gathered during the requirement workshops were reviewed and consolidated into the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).,0
  The purpose of the WUT RTM is to document and manage the business and functional requirements for the WUT Project.,0
"  The WUT RTM provides a master list of business and functional requirements organized into a number of meaningful features, each of which is a set of logically related requirements.",0
"  Within the matrix, each requirement is mapped to one or more use cases within the WUT Use Case Model that supports the requirement.",0
"  Once all requirements are mapped to a use case, SWFWMD is guaranteed that all business and functional requirements will be supported by the WUT software system.",0
   success by prioritizing the features and/or requirements associated with each feature across the various releases of the WUT System.,0
"  For purposes of requirements management and traceability, the requestor(s) of each requirement is included in the matrix.",0
  This allows the project development team to easily know whom to contact if questions or concerns arise during the development of the system regarding a certain requirement.,0
"  The capability to map these requirements increases the likelihood that upon the customer acceptance of a software solution that supports all the use cases within the Use Case Model, the project development team will have delivered a software product that fulfills the customers needs.",0
"  As more detailed and precise information is learned about the water use permitting analysis and reporting business processes throughout the WUT Project life cycle, the WUT RTM will be updated to refine existing requirements statements and to capture new business and functional requirements as they are identified.",1
  Keeping the WUT RTM updated is a critical success factor because it provides one of the primary mechanisms for measuring and ensuring the success of the WUT Project.,0
"  That is, the mapping of business and functional requirements to use cases ensures that these requirements drive the software engineering effort through design, implementation, and testing as a result of the use case realization process utilized by the WUT Project Development Team.",0
"  Once all the use cases within the WUT Use Case Model have been implemented, then all the business and functional requirements have been satisfied and the WUT Project will have completed successfully.",0
3,0
"3 Use Case Model and Use Cases The use case model primarily sets the functional requirements on the system, and is used as an essential input to analysis and architectural design.",0
"  In essence, the use case model and use cases are a contract between the project development team and the stakeholders with regards to the functionality of the system.",0
  The initial release of the model in the inception phase is used to outline the scope of the system.,0
  The use case model is refined by more detailed flows of events during the elaboration and construction phases.,0
  The use case model is continuously kept consistent with the design model.,0
  The use case model consists of use case packages.,0
"  A use case package is a collection of use cases, actors, relationships, diagrams, and other packages.",0
  It is used to structure the model by dividing it into smaller parts.,0
"  The WUT Use Case Model consists of two packages:  Maintain Water Use Tracking Information  View Water Use Permit Information  The functionality of a system is defined by use cases, each of which represents a specific flow of events.",0
  The description of a use case defines what happens in the system when the use case is performed.,0
  All functional requirements must be able to be linked to at least one use case.,0
  This ensures all required functionality is being included in the system to be built.,0
  Use cases contain several key items:  Business Context  A description of the business need of the use case.,0
    Pre-Conditions  A list of any conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed.,0
  Flow of Events  The sequence of events that can take place during the execution of the use case.,0
"  This includes the Primary Flow, or basic path, Alternate Flows, Warning Flows, and Exception Flows.",0
"  Post-Conditions  A list of conditions that can be expected after the use cases ends, dependent on the flow of events executed.",0
  Special Requirements  A list of any special requirements for a particular use case.,0
  This is a catch-all section where any information regarding a use case can be captured and stored.,0
  The users and any other system that may interact with the system are the actors.,0
"  Because they represent system users, actors help delimit the system and give a clearer picture of what it is supposed to do.",0
  Use cases are developed on the basis of the actors' needs.,0
  This ensures that the system will turn out to be what the users expected.,0
  Also included in the use case model are the use case diagrams.,0
  These diagrams illustrate the use cases and the actors and the interaction between the two.,0
  Use case diagrams can also be organized by use case packages to show only what is relevant within a particular package.,0
  The WUT Use Case Model was created and is currently stored in the Enterprise Architect modeling tool.,0
  The model includes all requirements gathered to-date for the project.,0
  The model also has all use cases that will be developed for the WUT System.,0
  All requirements are linked within the model to one or more use cases.,0
  All the actors identified for the project are also in the model.,0
  The use case diagrams show the interaction between the actors and the use cases.,0
3,0
"4 Supplementary Specification In contrast to business and functional requirements, non-functional requirements are system requirements that cannot be readily traced to specific use cases within the Use Case Model but are nonetheless critical to the overall success of the software project.",0
"  In general, there are two types of non-functional requirements, qualitative and general systems.",0
"  The first type of non-functional requirements are actually constraints upon the various functions, tasks, or behaviors that constitute the systems business and functional requirements and are, thus, commonly considered to be the qualitative aspects of the proposed software system.",0
  Qualitative systems requirements include considerations like:  Usability  Reliability  Performance  Supportability  Performance Measures  The other type of non-functional requirements is general systems requirements typical to most software engineering projects.,0
  No specific general systems requirements were gathered during the requirement workshops for the WUT Project.,0
   Software Architecture Document created during the Elaboration Phase of the project.,0
"  General systems requirements include considerations like:  Security  Relational Database Management System  Backup and Recovery and Disaster Recovery  User Documentation and Training  Because non-functional requirements cannot be traced to specific use cases within the use case model or, in some cases like security, apply to all use cases within the use case model, these requirements are typically not documented in the Requirements Traceability Matrix.",0
"  Rather, non-functional requirements are documented and managed through a separate deliverable called a Supplementary Specification.",0
"  The purpose of the WUT Supplementary Specification is to document and manage the non-functional requirements, or the qualitative and general systems requirements that are not mapped to a specific use cases within the WUT Use Case Model.",0
  These requirements were collected during the Requirement Workshops held during the Inception Phase of the project.,0
  This Supplementary Specification will be managed and iteratively refined as appropriate throughout the life of the WUT Project.,0
  The Supplementary Specification will be a valuable aid to all members of the WUT Project Development Team.,0
  This specification will be used as a communication medium between the development team and the Project Stakeholders with regards to both qualitative and general systems requirements.,0
"  The Development Team itself will use the supplementary specification as a reference when designing responsibilities, operations, and attributes on classes within the WUT Design Model, and when adjusting the classes within the model to the proposed implementation environment.",0
"  Finally, the supplementary specification will be used to verify compliance of the non-functional requirements during the testing of the WUT software.",0
   4 WUT Requirements 4.,0
1 WUT Requirements Traceability Matrix The current version of the WUT RTM is organized into two sections:  Requirements for the Initial Release of the WUT System  Requirements Identified for a Possible Subsequent Release of the WUT System  The first section identifies the set of business and functional requirements that will be supported in the initial release of the WUT System and the second section is comprised of the balance of the requirements that will be prioritized by the WUT Project Manager for a subsequent release of system.,0
"  Within each section, the requirements are organized into a number of features, each of which is a logically related set of requirements.",0
"  Within each feature, the requirements are documented and managed within a matrix or table comprised of the following columns:   Req ID  A unique identifier for each requirement  Requirement Statement  Individual WUT business and functional requirements expressed as a sentence that includes the word shall, will or must  Use Case  A unique name that identifies the WUT Use Case that supports the requirement 4.",0

2 Use Cases Identifying use cases in a use case model is only the critical first step.,0
  The business processes identified by each use case in the use case model must be described in detail in a narrative document.,0
  This narrative describes the behaviors the resulting software system must be designed to support.,0
"  However, following the iterative nature of RUP, not all use cases are fully completed during the initial phase of the project.",0
  A selection of critical and architecturally significant use cases were identified to be completed during the initial phase of the project.,0
  Figure 2 below shows the Use Case diagram illustrating all the use cases identified to-date for the WUT Project.,0
        Figure 2  WUT Use Case Diagram  The critical and architecturally significant use cases identified for the initial release have been completed and are included in the Appendix of this document.,0
"   Although not all use cases will be fully realized during the initial release of the system, a Business Context has been created for every use case shown in the diagram in Figure 2.",1
  The following sections contain these business contexts.,0
4,0

", View Water Use Permit information, performing spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps, or running a report).",0
    The information and features available to the actor will be controlled through the WUT System role-based security and WUT System Roles and their associated privileges.,1
"  When the actor initially requests access, the WUT System will determine the actors role and this will, in turn, determine the features available to the actor.",1
  Any actor not explicitly assigned to a WUT System Access Criteria role (i.,0
e.,0
", WUT Admin User, WUT Manager User) will, by default, be assigned to the WUT System General User Role.",1
  This general role will be allowed to access all features that are not restricted to a specific WUT user role.,1
4,0
2,0
2,0
2 Generate Well Package This use case will be used when an actor needs to generate a well package file for import into Groundwater Vistas to model the impact of well/withdrawal changes.,0
"  The well package is a comma-delimited file that contains many attributes, including location information, regarding water withdrawal wells within the District.",0
"  The well package is used as input into in the creation of the District-wide Regulatory Model, as well as in the creation of regional models.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
3 Maintain Business Rule Parameters This use case will be used when an actor needs to update business rule parameters within the WUT System.,0
"  Generally, these parameters are used in making specific calculations within the system.",0
"  For example, information in the SWUCA II rules explicitly defines how a Lapsed Quantity or Water Withdrawal Credits are calculated.",0
  Any parameter that could be used in a calculation could be maintained using this use case.,0
"  It is important to note that these parameters will not be used to change the original information stored in the database, but would be used to create ""derived"" data to be shown within reports or on the screen.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
4 Maintain Quick Links This use case will be used when an actor needs to manage the quick links located on the WUT Home Page.,0
  These are links to other websites that could be helpful to a WUT user.,0
"  For example, a link to other water district's websites to possibly view water use permit information could helpful.",0
"  If a permit is requested near the boundary of the District, the ability to view data from the adjacent District would be helpful in determining the impacts of the new permit.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
5 Maintain Water Use Estimates This use case will be used when an actor needs to maintain water use estimation values for water use permits.,0
  The permitted quantity is known for all water use permits.,0
"  However, the actual pumpage is only known for those permittees that submit their data.",0
"  For those permits that do not submit pumpage data, their water use is estimated, based on the data that is submitted from other wells.",0
"  Currently, the water use estimates are stored in Excel spreadsheets and SAS datasets.",0
"  Currently, this data can only be viewed in summarized form in the Water Use Estimates document published annually.",0
  This use case will allow the actor to import water use estimate data for each water use permit into a database table that can be used by the WUT System.,0
"  This will allow users of the system to view pumpage data, as an estimated value, even for permittees that do not submit their pumpage information.",1
4,0
2,0
2,0
6 Maintain WUT News This use case is used when the actor needs to maintain WUT news items for communication to users when they access the WUT Home Page.,0
"  For example, the system administrator may need to inform WUT users that the system will be down for maintenance over the weekend.",0
"  Using this feature, the system administrator can create a system maintenance news item for display starting and ending on specified dates.",0
  Displaying news on the WUT Home Page ensures that all users will have access to this important information when they first access the application.,0

7 Process Database Replication This use case will be used when an actor needs to replicate and normalize (restructure) data that has been copied directly from a DB2 database on the IBM mainframe to a read-only Oracle database.,0
  The current data structure was implemented to support a data entry system and not for the use in a decision support reporting system.,0
  The data is being restructured to take advantage of the strengths of a relational database management system.,0
"  After the initial replication of the DB2 tables, nightly updates are made to the Oracle tables with the data that has changed since the previous replication process.",0
"  By normalizing the data into relational tables, it will allow the data to be more accessible using ad-hoc query tools.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
8 View Change in Use Type or Owner This use case will be used when an actor needs to view information about the relocation of permitted quantities associated with a specific water use permit.,0
"  When an application is made to relocate permitted quantities and change the use type or owner of an existing permitted quantity that impacts an MFL waterbody that is below its minimum level, the application is subject to certain criteria.",0
  The previously permitted quantity is first reviewed under the reasonable beneficial use test.,0
"  The quantity available for the new owner or new use type is limited to 90 percent of the permitted historically used portion of the reasonable-beneficial quantity, not including any Drought Credit quantities.",0
  This 10 percent reduction in historically used permitted reasonable-beneficial quantity impacting the MFL waterbodies constitutes a Net Benefit.,0
"  If any reasonable beneficial, historically unused quantities will remain on the source permit, these quantities are also reduced by the Net Benefit provision (i.",0
e.,0
", 10 percent) and are available only for the existing use type at the source permit site.",0
"   used quantities will remain on the source permit, these quantities are not subject to the Net Benefit provisions and may be used for the existing use type.",0
"  Any future application to modify the use type or owner, or to relocate with a change in use type or owner, these remaining reasonable-beneficial, historically used quantities will be subject to the Net Benefit provisions.",0
  Any historically unused quantities remaining at the source permit site may not be relocated in the future and may not have a change in use type.,0
  The following information will be displayed pertaining to the relocation of a WUP:  Historical used quantity  Historical unused quantity  Reasonable beneficial quantity  The WUP that the relocated amount came from  The WUP that the relocated amount went to  The dates that any of these values took affect or changed 4.,1
2,0
2,0
9 View Compliance Information This use case will be used when an actor needs to view Compliance data associated with a specific water use permit.,1
"  Depending on the data submitted by the permittee, compliance data could include pumpage quantities, meter readings, crop reports, well construction specifications, and any other condition data associated with a water use permit.",0
"  Providing compliance information will give District staff time-saving devices with which they can better monitor the enforcement activities of the District, with minimal impact to staff time.",0
  Better access to those who are not submitting pumpage information will help evaluators better determine the site conditions while evaluating the impacts of new applications in the same area.,0

2,0
10 View Crop Report Information This use case will be used when an actor needs to view crop report data associated with a specific permit.,0
  Crop report data is collected on an annual or semi-annual basis and is submitted by the permittee.,0
"  A different form is submitted for recreational use, annual crops, and seasonal crops.",0
"  It contains the crop or use type, acreage for each use, predominate soil type, and planting dates.",0
"  The data submitted with crop reports, in many cases, is not audited for accuracy, and is often incomplete or inaccurate.",0
"  The primary purposes of this form are to verify the actual soil type for the location so that more accurate water allocations can be made, link the actual ground conditions to the use information in the database, and monitor the use of water conserving credits.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
11 View Land Use Information This use case will be used when an actor needs to view land use data associated with a specific water use permit.,0
  Possible scenarios include viewing trends for specified areas or determining how water use changed as land use changes.,0
"    Land use data can be collected during permit submittal or as conditions set on a permit, as well as from map analysis.",0
  Permittees will supply land use information as water use code types or from crop reports submitted for certain WUPs.,0
"   layer derived from Florida's land use cover classification system (FLUCCS), color infrared (CIR) digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQs), or other aerial photography.",0

2,0
12 View Lapsed or Project Quantities Summary This use case will be used when an actor needs to view lapsed or project quantities data associated with a specific water use permit.,0
"  With the implementation of the new SWUCA rules, this process will allow the actor to track these quantities.",1
  Most of the land within the SWUCA is associated with an existing water use permit.,0
"  Over time, permits are reduced, abandoned due to land use changes or abandonment of an activity, retired due to acquisition of land for preservation purposes, or by other means.",0
"  Historically, this permit activity has resulted in an overall reduction in water use.",0
"  Now, however, these lapsed quantities will be available for new and expanding water users to meet their needs.",1
  Another way for a water use permit applicant to get water that meets their needs is by the use of quantities that are associated with District projects.,0
4,0
2,0
2,0
13 View Map This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water use permit (WUP) information spatially using a map created with the functionality provided by a Geographic Information Systems (GIS).,0
"  Viewing WUP information in a pre-defined report format can be very effective from the point of view of efficiency, organization, and the presentation of large amounts of data.",0
"  Even so, a report is simply a one-dimensional presentation of information when that information has at its basis a spatial context.",0
"  When viewing WUP information in a report, the subtlety and complexity of the spatial relationships cannot be presented at all or is, at best, difficult to comprehend.",0
   The viewing of information within its spatial context is exactly where GIS excels and is the primary reason for this View Map Use Case.,0
"  When additional GIS layers are added to a map, the multi-dimensional presentation of information provides for a richness of analysis simply not possible using a report format.",0
"  Although not intended exclusively for this actor, one of the primary actors who will use this use case is the WUP Evaluators.",0
"  They are responsible for the analysis of all new, modified, and renewed WUPs.",0
"  During the analysis process, the evaluator will frequently require access to a map to view WUP data within its spatial context.",1
  Doing so will enable the evaluator to view other important data within the area of interest resulting in a far richer analytical effort.,0
"  By having the ability to add different GIS layers to the map, the evaluator will have more information at their disposal to assist in their analytical effort.",0
"  Add to this the capability to pan, zoom, and print at any time, the evaluator will have all the information and functionality required to make better, more informed decisions.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
14 View Mitigation of MFL Impacts This use case will be used when an actor needs to view information of how a specific water use permit has mitigated its impact on a MFL waterbody.,0
"  When an applicant demonstrates compliance with all conditions for issuance, except that it impacts a minimum flow or level waterbody, the applicant can apply for a permit if they provide a Net Benefit to the impacted MFL waterbody.",0
   development project that more than negates their proposed impact or it could be the purchasing of adjacent land with water use permits for their own use.,0
  The following information will be displayed to show the mitigation of MFL impacts:  The permits and their quantities that were bought out to mitigate the MFL impact  The Districts projects and their quantities used to mitigate the MFL impact  The self-funded projects and their quantities used to mitigate the MFL impact 4.,1
2,0
2,0
15 View Net Benefit Summary This use case will be used when an actor needs to analyze Net Benefit data associated with a specific water use permit.,0
"  With the implementation of the new SWUCA rules, this process will allow the actor to track the Net Benefits.",0
"  A Net Benefit is obtained when the proposed withdrawal, coupled with other activities or measures, will result in an improvement to the MFL waterbody that more than offsets the impact of the withdrawal.",0
"  In all Net Benefit options, reasonable beneficial use plays a key part.",0
"  Permits are granted based upon meeting numerous rule criteria including that the quantities requested are fully needed for the proposed use, or existing use in case of a renewal.",0
  The applicant for a new permit or for a modification or renewal of an existing permit is required to file detailed information to demonstrate and justify to the reasonable satisfaction of the District the reasonable beneficial quantities intended to be used during the term of the proposed permit before it will be issued.,0
  This requirement is intended to assist the District in seeking to reduce the difference between permitted quantities and used quantities.,0
"  For those cases in which an applicant is seeking a modification or renewal of an existing permit, the District will consider historical use, metered pumping data, trends and patterns of usage, actual type of usage, and other relevant factors.",0
"  A Net Benefit can be obtained in several ways including:  Relocation with a change in use type or owner  Water withdrawal credits  Mitigation of minimum flow and level impacts  There are several ways that the District is going to gain water with the new SWUCA rules, from reclaimed water lines, lapsed quantities, water withdrawal credits, and the relocations rules.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
16 View Report This use case will be used when an actor needs to produce a report from within the WUT Report Library.,0
  It is anticipated that the WUT System will have a large number of reports available in its report library.,0
  Every report use case within the WUT Report Library will extend this use case as appropriate for the specific report.,0
  A report in this library provides information in a pre-defined format.,0
   specific area of interest (e.,0
g.,0
", a specific county).",0
  This is accomplished through report specifications.,0
"  While a given report may be run frequently, the information content will often vary from report to report based upon the run-time report specifications given by the actor.",0
   This use case provides support for the numerous reports within the WUT Report Library.,0
"  Once the actor specifies the report of interest and optionally supplies any run-time report criteria, the system will retrieve the information for the actor and present it in the pre-defined format.",0
"  The actor can then choose to simply view the report online or download the report for analysis, printing, or saving as an electronic file in a variety of supported formats.",0
4,0
2,0
2,0
17 View Resource Information This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water resource data associated with a specific water use permit.,0

4,0
2,0
2,0
18 View Use of Lapsed Quantities This use case will be used when an actor needs to view the use of lapsed quantities associated with a specific water use permit.,0
" Historically, reduced, abandoned, and retired permits have resulted in an overall reduction in water use.",0
"  But now, these quantities will be a primary means for many new or expanding water users to meet their needs.",0
"  Where an applicant demonstrates compliance with all conditions for issuance, except that it impacts an MFL waterbody, the applicant can apply for up to 90% of the water it has identified as historically used by a water use permit holder that has permanently discontinued their use and abandoned their permit.",0
"  The applicant must also demonstrate that other Net Benefit options, including relocation, mitigation, participation in a District Source Augmentation Project, are not feasible.",0
  This Net Benefit provision applies only when the previous water use was derived from a source where the permanently discontinued use had a similar or greater effect on the impacted MFL waterbody as the proposed use.,0
"  One of the main goals of the WUT System is to track changes in permitted and used quantities so that historically used, reasonable beneficial quantities potentially available from reduced, abandoned, or retired permits and their relation to MFL waterbodies will be known for potential applicants and for District decision making.",0
  Quantities of water retired from land acquisition programs are included for use as lapsed quantities unless the acquiring agency specifically requests for them to be excluded from use.,0
    Whether a WUPs quantity has been excluded from the lapsed quantity pool as a result of a land acquisition program  The dates that any of these values took affect or changed 4.,0
2,0
2,0
19 View Use of Quantities Associated With District Projects This use case will be used when an actor needs to view the quantities used from District Source Augmentation Projects associated with a specific water use permit.,0

21 View Water Use Permit Search This use case will be used when an actor needs to search for and identify a water use permit for analysis.,0
"  This use case, as well as the View Map Use Case, is considered among the class of Find use cases.",0
"  A Find use case provides the capability to identify, locate, and access information within the WUT System, as it pertains to a water use permit.",0
  The View Water Use Permit Search use case enables the actor to efficiently and effectively search for and identify permits that meet a given search criteria.,0
  The system returns basic information about the permit with the ability to get more detailed information regarding the permit (i.,0
e.,0

22 View Water Withdrawal Credit This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water withdrawal credit information associated with a specific water use permit.,0
  A water withdrawal credit is an incentive for an applicant to provide other water use permit holders with alternative supplies.,0
  The holder of the credits can use them to provide a Net Benefit in order to obtain water from an MFL waterbody because the overall impact will be an improvement.,0
  The applicant (Supplier) provides an alternative supply to offset actual withdrawals from an existing permit holder (Receiver).,0
  The credit is 50% of the offset amount.,0
"  The discontinued quantities are placed in a standby permit and are given back to the Receiver in the event the Supplier ever stops providing the alternative source, essentially giving the Receiver their original quantity back.",0
  The following information will be displayed pertaining to the water withdrawal credits for a WUP:  The offset quantity coming from an alternative source  Where the alternative source coming from  The Supplier of the alternative source  The Receiver of the alternative source  The distribution of the credit (50% of the offset) between the Supplier and Receiver  The discontinued quantities to be stored in a standby permit  The dates that any of these values took affect or changed 4.,1

23 View Well Construction Information This use case will be used when an actor needs to view well construction information that is associated with a specific water use permit.,0
  Well construction information is gathered during the construction and permitting of the wells.,0
"  This information includes well depth, casing depth, well diameter, status code, drilling method, and completion date.",0
"  When a well also requires a Water Use Permit, some of this information is entered in both the Well Construction database and the Water Use Permit Well database.",0
  The two tables are loosely linked.,0
"  When the Water Use Permit and well number are entered into the Well Construction database, a link is created to that permit in the Water Use Permit Well database.",0
"  The actual information in the table is not updated, but another page of well construction information (well construction number, completion date, diameter, total and case depth, and well status) is available to view, but only on the specified revision.",0
"  The well completion information in the Well Construction database is considered to supersede the WUP Well information, which can contain estimated data.",0
  Depth information is important in determining what aquifer a well is pumping water from so the drawdown impacts for new water use can be calculated accurately.,0

24 View Withdrawal Pumpage Information This use case will be used when an actor needs to view withdrawal pumpage information associated with a specific water use permit.,0
  Pumpage data is collected at certain wells and estimated for others based on several categories of water and land use.,0
"  Most pumpage data is collected on a monthly basis, either through a permittee submittal or a utility company meter reading.",0
"  Based on these actual values, other wells that are not metered can be estimated.",0
"  Permittees submit their readings by mail, e-mail, or the Internet.",0

 Introduction 1.,0
"1 Purpose This document describes the requirements specification (SRS) for the software infrastructure (or product) that enables the internetworking of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) through peering, henceforth termed as CDN peering, and provides an overall description of it.",0
" It presents a means for distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate with other CDNs, by investigating and developing (a) models for effective internetworking between CDNs though peering; (b) protocols for service delivery in a cooperative environment of CDNs; (c) some concrete examples (technology trends) that exhibits the notion of content networking; and (d) policies for autonomic management of service level through resource negotiation in an on-demand basis.",0
" Thus, this document provides a basis for evaluating the proposal for internetworking between CDNs.",0
 This is the version 0.,0
1 of the software requirements specification.,0
1,0
"2 Document Conventions and Terminology When writing this SRS for CDN peering, the following terminologies are used:  Web server (WS): The container of content comprising of two layers?overlay, which is a collection of Web service host (e.",0
g.,0
" Apache, Tomcat), Service Level Agreement (SLA)-allocator, and policy agent, and core, which refers to the underlying hardware infrastructure.",0
"  Mediator: A policy-driven entity, authoritative for policy negotiation and management.",0
  Service registry (SR): Discovers and stores resource and policy information in local domain.,0
  Peering Agent (PA): A resource discovery module in the peering CDNs environment.,0
"  Policy repository (PR): A storage of Web server, mediator and peering policies.",0
  PWS: A set of Web server-specific rules for content storage and management.,0
  PM: A set of mediator-specific rules for interaction and negotiation.,0
  PPeering: A set of rules for creation and growth of the peering arrangement.,0

"3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions This document is written for the researchers, software developers, advanced practitioners, documentation writers, and users involved in CDN domain to initiation an open discussion for exploring development opportunities regarding the internetworking between CDNs.",0
 Section 2 discusses the steps that are to be undertaken to bring-up or cease an internetworking arrangement between CDNs.,0
" In the next section, system features with their functional requirements are presented to highlight the major services provided by the intended product.",0
 Then the external interface requirements highlighting the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users are discussed.,0
" Finally, this specification is concluded with the reference documents on which this document is based on.",0
1,0
"4 Project Scope The final product enabling CDN peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via internetworking among distinct CDNs to allow providers to rapidly scale-out to meet both flash crowds and anticipated increases in demand, and remove the need for a single CDN to provision resources.",0
"Software Requirements Specification for                                                                                                   Page 2 Internetworking of CDNs through Peering assignment and redirection, enabling content replication and determining appropriate compensation among participants on a geographically distributed Internet scale.",0
" In contrast to a single CDN, for which these issues are deeply interrelated and co-dependent, the main thrust for the final product enabling CDN peering is to consider them in a coordinated and cooperative manner among many peered CDNs, whilst satisfying the complex multi-dimensional constraints placed on each individual provider.",0
" Each provider must ensure that their individual SLAs are met when serving content for its own customers to end users, while meeting any obligations it has made when participating in a group of many providers.",0

5 References This document builds on the following references:  An introduction to CDN technologies [1].,0
  The research problem for internetworking of CDNs [2]  The architecture for CDN peering [3].,0
  The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4].,0
  CDN peering models along with the challenges for implementation [5].,0

 Overall Description 2.,0
1 Product Perspective CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise.,0
" It is formed by a set of autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers.",0
 It is expected that an effective peering arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur.,0
1,0
" Initiation:  A CDNs reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load, cost of equipment, scalable infrastructure, and/or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure.",0
 Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s).,0
" It is triggered by an initialization request sent to the mediator under exceptional circumstances, e.",0
g.,0
" flash crowds, when the (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its Web Servers (WSs).",0
 The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN.,0
2,0
 Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect with other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship.,0
" In the business domain, this relationship (most likely) would take the form of a legal document which describes the expected level of services from the involving parties such as storage requirements, the required rate of transfer, cost of services; the expected duration of receiving service, penalties for service violations, and other preconditions such as the initiating CDNs preference to gain resources at a particular region.",0
 Negotiated relationships can also be established through means non-technical terms (financial statement) or technical terms (SLAs).,0
" Thus, negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs.",0
" In the CDN peering architecture, the mediator instance obtains the resource and access information from the Service Registry (SR), whilst SLAs and other policies from the Policy Repository (PR).",0
 The mediator instance on the primary CDNs behalf generates its service requirements based on the current circumstance and SLA requirements of its customer(s).,0
Software Requirements Specification for                                                                                                   Page 3 Internetworking of CDNs through Peering allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy.,0
3,0
" Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with.",0
 The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers.,0
" The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs.",0
 If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point.,0
"  Otherwise, it carries out short term negotiations with the Peering Agent (PA) identified peering targets.",0
4,0
 CDN peering protocols: The next step is to configure the CDN peering protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships.,0
" This step includes advertising the configurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.",0
) of enlisted CDNs through inter-PA communication.,0
" On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer.",0
 Request-redirection in a peering arrangement depends on the content distribution and request-routing policies (specified in the CDN peering protocols) associated with the content as well as the specific algorithms and methods used for directing these requests.,0
5,0
" Operational management: When the primary CDN acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its SLA with the customer, the new peering arrangement becomes operational.",0
" Hence, necessary functional policies are deployed and administered in an effective way.",0
" Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s).",0
 Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships.,0
" If no CDN is interested in such peering, peering arrangement creation through re-negotiation is resumed by tuning the negotiated relationships with reconsidered service requirements.",0
6,0
 Disband or re-arrangement: An existing peering arrangement may need to either disband or re-arrange itself (within the scope of the negotiated relationships) if any of the following conditions hold: (a) the circumstances under which the arrangement was formed no longer hold; (b) peering is no longer beneficial for the participating CDNs; (c) an existing peering arrangement needs to be expanded further in order to deal with additional load; or (d) participating CDNs are not meeting their agreed upon contributions.,0

  Assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.,0
e.,0
 flash crowds) effectively.,0
 The operations performed by the product components [3] assist to realize the above goals.,0
 Component-wise major functions are noted below.,0
" The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents are as follows,  A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use.",0
"  In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering.",0
  The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs.,0
  The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.,0
    The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web servers resources (e.,0
g.,0
" CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.",0
") to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced.",0
"  The Web servers underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers.",0
"  The Mediator performs the following major functions,  It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships.",0
  It passes the service requirements to the PA.,0
  It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.,0
"  Once a peering arrangement is established, it controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.",0
e.,0
" end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used.",0
"   It ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience) The main functions of the Service Registry are as follows,  It encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN.",0
"   It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.",0
"   In the face of traffic surges, it supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator.",0
"  When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.",0
" The Policy Repository is used to perform the following functions,  It virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including PWS, PM, and PPeering (i.",0
e.,0
" Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement.",0
"Software Requirements Specification for                                                                                                   Page 6 Internetworking of CDNs through Peering  It provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement.",0
  It returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements.,0
" A Peering Agent carries out the following major functions,  It acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations.",0
"  It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs.",0
  It is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them.,0
" The operations performed by the components of the CDN peering is driven by semi-autonomous logic that ensures content is served reliably through content replication, request-routing and redirection whilst maintaining constant awareness of the health (e.",0
g.,0
 load information) of participants.,0
 These major architectural features of the CDN peering are briefly described in the following:  Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data.,0
" Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute.",0
"    Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.",0
e.,0
" mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or threshold-based manner.",0
 The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers.,0
"  Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels  at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster.",0
" Therefore, end-users can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate.",0
2,0
3 User Classes and Characteristics The users of the software infrastructure enabling CDN peering can be differentiated by using their membership and contributions to the system.,0
 A given peering arrangement consists of explicit and implicit members.,0
" Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing.",0
 Implicit members are content providers and end-users.,0
 Implicit members are transparent to a peering arrangement but they share the benefit from it.,0
" In addition, users can vary based on the purpose, size, scope and duration of peering.",0
" For instance, a short-term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time frame?as it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the evolved niche.",0
" On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNs strategic goals.",0
 Users can also be classified because of the preferential treatment that they may receive due to the policy that pertains to a particular providers business logic.,0
" Moreover, individual users (or a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in customized content delivery.",0
" Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on user-defined QoS specifications while accessing the service.",0
Software Requirements Specification for                                                                                                   Page 7 Internetworking of CDNs through Peering 2.,0
4 Operating Environment The product (i.,0
e.,0
" prototype system) enabling CDN peering is expected to be deployed it in a real-world test bed such as PlanetLab for global testing, observations, and for performance evaluation.",0
" In this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of leveraging them.",0
 A modular implementation stack could be developed on top of the existing standard application layer (e.,0
g.,0
" Apache, Tomcat) and protocols (e.",0
g.,0
" HTTP, CDI, HTPC).",0
 A modular implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure correct implementation.,0
 It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants.,0
 Load information could be measured and disseminated within individual CDNs and among other CDNs using distributed load indices such as Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or variations of it.,0
" Request assignment and redirection could predominantly rely on DNS-level end-user assignment combined with a rudimentary request assignment policy such as weighted round-robin or least-loaded-first, which updates the DNS records to point to the most appropriate replica server of the peers.",0
2,0
"5 Design and Implementation Constraints The challenges in developing the product include virtualization of multiple providers and offloading end-user requests from the primary CDN provider to peers based on cost, performance and load.",0
" Due to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual provider within its own Web servers.",0
" Therefore, request-redirections must occur over distributed sets of Web servers belonging to multiple CDN providers, without the benefit of the full information available, as in the single provider case.",0
" Moreover, an implementation model for the product enabling CDN peering could be based on a complex combination of attributes such as Web server responsiveness or load, expected network delay, or geographic location.",0
 Several of these potential attributes vary over time and there is no single repository for listing the value of attributes such as geographic location or expected delay for all Internet-connected systems.,0
 It is anticipated that the values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics.,0
2,0
"6 User Documentation Along with the software product, a user manual would be written to help people understand the working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system.",0
" It would be written for non-technical individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex.",0
" The user manual would follow common user documentation styles capturing purpose and scope of the product along with key system features and operations; step-by-step instructions for using the system including conventions, messaging structures, quick references, tips for errors and malfunctions; pointers  to reference documents; and glossary of terms.",0
2,0
7 Assumptions and Dependencies The product would build on leveraging existing systems.,0
" In this regard, necessary inspirations could be obtained by analyzing related systems such as CoDeeN, Coral, Globule, and MotusNet.",0
" In particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear guideline for developing the intended prototype.",0

Overall Description,0
Product Perspective,0
"Virtual-EDU consists of an online website that allows users to create a classroom like environment with the features that it contains. Once registered to the system, a user can create a profile sharing his or her information with the rest of the enrolled users. Users will be able to find commonalities with each other through the user profile. Virtual-EDU also gives users the ability to store data and/or important materials in a secure network location for future retrieval or present usage. This particular data as well as other files may be shared or worked on using Virtual-EDU extensive tools for file sharing and document collaboration. Users can work together on a single document in real time or send their work to other users via secure file sharing methods and protocols. If further communication is need between users, Virtual-EDU has features such as instant messaging, where users can hold single or group conversations via a secure real-time communication based on typed text. However, if more efficient means of communication are need, users have the ability to hold single or group video/audio conferences, whereby the users will be able to see other users streamed live in real-time.",0

"Virtual-Space consists of folder space set aside for each student to upload files to.  An uploading feature would be the only component available in the first release, which would aid in handing in assignments.  This feature is of medium priority as email can still be used as a means for this type of document sharing.  The cost of implementing this feature would include insuring each class section a space on an FTP server.",1

Description and Priority,0
"In the second release of Virtual-EDs Virtual-Space features would be added to include full file management for any uploaded files.  In this release, FTP space would be designated by student rather than by class section.  Disk space quotas would need to be implemented to preserve resources.  Each student would be able to upload files to share with team members or to turn in assignments.  Arranging by folders and deleting files would also be newly added capabilities.  ",1
"This would incur a higher cost to accommodate more disk space, and would also require an administrator to spend more time managing the FTP accounts.  The first release version of this feature was of medium priority, so adding more capabilities to it would be of low priority as email is still a highly usable alternative.",0
