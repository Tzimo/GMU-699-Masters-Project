1. Introduction",0
1.1 Purpose and Perspective,0
"A program of the Georgia Public Library Service, Georgia Library PINES (Public Information Network for Electronic Services) is the public library automation and lending network for more than 275 libraries and affiliated service outlets in almost 140 counties.  PINES creates a statewide ""borderless library"" that provides equal access to information for all Georgians. Georgians with a PINES library card have access to materials beyond what is available on their local shelves and enjoy the benefits of a shared collection of 9.6 million books and other materials that can be delivered to their home library free of charge.  PINES has been running its shared bibliographic and patron databases on the Evergreen ILS, which was originally developed by the Georgia Public Library Service for use in PINES.",0
"This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the functional and nonfunctional requirements for Management Processes of an Integrated Library System (ILS). The requirements, while originally developed specifically for King County Library System, have been adapted for the Public Information Network for Electronic Services (PINES) as they are believed to be suitable for many large, urban, multiple-branch, centralized library systems. ",0
"The requirements in this SRS presuppose the general data structures and functionality of a full-fledged ILS. The Management Processes will replace and enhance the current capabilities of Evergreen, as well as add new functionality. ",0
1.1a Formation and  of PINES Reports Working Group,0
"The PINES Reports Working Group was formed in response to a need to make recommendations for improvements of the Evergreen ILS reports interface.    () Library System, in collaboration with the Galecia Group, had already developed a software requirements specification for a reports interface and PINES staff took the opportunity to build a PINES-specific requirements document on that foundation.  Katherine Gregory, PINES Services Specialist, requested group members from the existing PINES Reports Subcommittee, and included PINES library directors in a call for volunteers.  The resulting PINES Reports Working Group consists of one library director, three assistant library directors, and a systems librarian, all of whom have significant experience developing reports for PINES libraries.  The mission statement of the PINES Reports Working Group is as follows:",0
"
Reports Working Group :",0
Document optimal Reports functionality within a future Evergreen release and develop a list of requirements.,0
"Become the Reports testing group, through which all new Reports development would be filtered.",0
Compile a list of reports needed for an Executive Reports Interface.,0
Determine and create templates needed for all PINES libraries.,0
1.2 Product Scope and Features,0
"The Management Processes facilitates the management of Library services, programs, and policies. Specifically, the Management Processes support the following activities, among others: ",0
Analyzing the Library collection and its use by patrons. ,0
Analyzing branch capacity and optimal distribution of the collection. ,0
Analyzing the demographics and interests of the Library’s patrons. ,0
Analyzing staff productivity and workflow. ,0
Tracking and verifying financial transactions. ,0
The current specification presupposes the general functionality of an ILS and specifies only those requirements that directly or indirectly relate to management activities. PINES is currently working on specifications for Acquisitions and Cataloging modules.,0
"Moreover, the current specification is focused on functional characteristics of Management Processes. Data structures and user interfaces will require further specification and development using an iterative, prototype-oriented software development methodology. ",0
1.3 Intended Audience,0
"This SRS is intended both for library managers and staff who may contribute additional requirements or commentary, and for software project managers and developers who will implement the requirements. As such, it aims for a high level of readability for a non-technical audience, while providing enough specificity to be useful to a software developer.  ",0
"It is assumed that when software development occurs, it will be in a highly collaborative and iterative environment in which end-users have multiple opportunities to review prototypes and refine the user interface and software functionality. ",0
It is also assumed that the reader has a general understanding of Library services and processes and does not require definition of common Library terminology. ,0
1.4 Document Conventions,0
"The SRS includes requirements. Requirements include a reference to a process flowchart where appropriate. Flowcharts generally indicate the current approach to Management Processes in PINES, and should be considered to give contextual information rather than to prescribe or constrain new software development. ",0
1.5 User Classes and Characteristics,0
1.6 Operating Environment,0

"UD-4:	The system shall provide thorough high-level error reporting and feedback and shall allow low-level query-specific feedback for Local and Global System Administrators from the front-end interface.",0
1.9 Assumptions and Dependencies,0
"AS-1:	Management Processes are part of an enterprise-level Library Automation System. ",0
"AS-2:	Management Processes are consolidated at a central location, and accept input and provide services to multiple locations. ",0
"DE-1:	Management Processes rely on the data structures and functionality of an enterprise-level Library Automation System, including Acquisitions and Cataloging modules. ",0
"DE-2:	Management Processes interface with a variety of vendor websites, via published APIs and/or automated transfer of standard-format data files (e.g. USMARC21, EDIFACT). ",0
"DE-3:	Management Processes interact with a patron interface, also known as an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC).",0

 Overall Description 2.,0
1 Product Perspective The program is a new self-contained product.,0
 It has come about due to the demand for such a product being identified in a series of Ethnography studies.,0
 From these studies we saw that the main activity people used video for was the watch content found online.,0
" These people would regularly spend periods of time searching websites to try and find the videos they wanted to watch, either somewhere to stream the video from or the files to download the video.",0
" This was especially true of the studies by Alan Woosnam, Irshad Qabool and Will Josephy.",0
 Our system will aim to speed up this process.,0
2,0
2 Product Features The main feature of the system will be a search engine for finding the location of torrents and streaming sites for videos on the internet.,0
 The user can specify which of the 2 or both to look for.,0
" The results will be divided into the types that were specified using different tabs, and then the results will be orderable by different categories, such as name, size, site, etc.",0
" The user will have the option to filter out videos containing certain content depending on age restrictions, for example adult content.",0
 In addition the user will have the option to filter out or only search certain websites; for example a user may only want to look at videos on YouTube.,0
" They will have the facility for users to store their favorite videos, so that they can come back to the video at another time.",0
2,0
3 User Classes and Characteristics There will be two levels of user for our system.,0
 The first will be the general user that will be using our software to find their videos.,0
 They will only see the front end of the system.,0
 The second level will be the system developers.,0
" They will be able to edit which sites the system will search, depending on whether they think the site is safe, compatible with our software, the speed at which the site can be searched, and how useful the site is to us, i.",0
e.,0
 how many results have come back from that site.,0
2,0
"4 Operating Environment The system will be portable; this means it will work across different operating systems including Microsoft XP and Vista, Mac OS X and a range of Linux platforms.",0
" Also it will work with different web browsers, for example Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.",0
  The hardware needed for our system will be a reasonably up-to-date computer that is connected to the internet via a modem.,0

Software Requirements Specification for x-ray  Page 7 4.,0
 External Interface Requirements 4.,0
"1 User Interfaces The user Interface will consist of one main screen, allowing all the functionally to come from this one screen.",0
 This allows the user to use the software with ease by not flicking through a number of different screens.,0
 In addition to this the user can always see the videos they are looking for.,0
 The main screen will be laid out as in Appendix: B Diagram along with the description of the diagram.,0
 We decided on this type of interface because we felt that it would be very simple for the user to navigate.,0
" From our reports we found that the simpler the interface was, the more people liked it.",0
  With all these features complied into one screen it will give the software more flexibility and allows for easy and simple usage.,0
 This will appeal to both naïve computer users and experienced computer users with a higher selling market.,0
4,0
2 Software Interfaces The software will use hyperlinks to allow the user to open websites in their default web browser.,0
4,0
3 Communications Interfaces Communication standards that will be used through the software will be PHP or other such languages.,0
Software Requirements Specification for x-ray  Page 8 5.,0

 REQ-2: Sending the hyperlink to the default browser will take less than 1 second.,1
 REQ-3: Loading the program will take less than 10 seconds.,1
 REQ-4: Any torrent result with 0 seeds will not be displayed.,1
 1 REQ-5: Sorting results should take less than 0.,1
1 seconds.,0
 REQ-6: A results page will display 100 results.,1
 REQ-7: Any torrent result with a rating of less than 1 will not be displayed.,1
 2  1 – Any torrent with 0 seeds cannot guarantee to be fully downloaded.,0
 2 – Any torrent with a rating of less than 1 should not be fully trusted; this was one of the main complaints from users in William Josephys ethnographic study.,0

"2 Safety Requirements Our development team must thoroughly investigate each website within our database each month, to ensure that no illegal or harmful content is exposed to our users.",0
5,0
3 Security Requirements We don’t maintain any user data or host any content.,0
5,0
"4 Legal Requirements While all safety measures resulting from the site may not be fully identified, a recommendation of a full legal review of the software should be undertaken before the site is available to the public.",0
" In doing so, the site will be subject to full indemnification of liability.",0
"  The system we produce will stay within all the legal requirements on our behalf, as our software is only listing links for video streams and video download, and this is not illegal.",0
 Our system will not host any videos.,0
Software Requirements Specification for x-ray  Page 9 Appendix A: Glossary  Terminology taken from Google:  Peer: A peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the Internet that you connect to and transfer data.,0
  Seed: a complete copy of the file being made available for download.,0
   Torrent: A Torrent in the Internet world is a site that uses BitTorrent technologies to host file for P2P file download and sharing.,0
 A torrent contains the location of data files that can be download from the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network.,0
 ...,0
Software Requirements Specification for x-ray  Page 10 Appendix B: Diagrams  4 13  2                                5 1- The first feature of the software is a menu bar.,0
" This software includes the basic features used in similar products such as new search, close, load etc.",0
 However with our software there are two extra features.,0
 These being a filter option which allows the user to set parental controls over the software.,0
 This enables the user to be able to search for videos without getting explicit content.,0
 In addition to this there is a favorite’s option.,0
" This feature gives the user the option of being able to store links to their favorite videos in the software, and be able to go back to these websites after restarting the software.",0
  2- This is the main engine behind the software.,0
 This is where the user enters the name of the video they wish to search for.,0
 Once the user has typed in the name of their desired video they can either press the enter key or the search button to run the query.,0
"   3- These tick boxes tell the software to search for either torrents or streaming videos, depending on what type of video the user wishes to view.",0
   4- These are the tabs which bring up the different pages of the search results.,0
 This allows the user to run multiple searches and keep different search results stored at the same time.,0
Software Requirements Specification for x-ray  Page 11  5- This is where the actual search results will be displayed.,0
" Within these display fields the user will be told the name of the video, the location of the video (which website the video is on), the size of the video so the user can decide if they wish to download the video or just to stream the video, the rating of the video with information on how safe the website is, and finally comments on the video (what other user think of the video).",0
 With this the user can then decide on how he wants the search results sorted using the column headers at the top.,0
Software Requirements Specification for x-ray  Page 12 Appendix C: Issues List In the next version we will consider adding a system to also search UseNet Binaries.,0

 The service shall be designed to meet the needs of all executive branch agencies and reduce the current cost of operation and support.,0
 The product of this project will be a proposed plan for the establishment of the statewide electronic mail system.,0
" By December 31, 2009, the AEIT shall submit the proposed plan to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.",0
" The plan shall be developed to reduce costs to the state and include, at a minimum:  a) An analysis of the in-house and external sourcing options that should be considered for delivery and support of the service.",0
" The analysis shall include an internally hosted system option, an externally sourced system option, and, if necessary, a combined in-house and externally sourced option.",0
"  b) A cost-benefit analysis that estimates all major cost elements associated with each sourcing  option, including the nonrecurring and recurring costs of each option.",0
 The analysis must also include a comparison of the total cost of each enterprise e-mail sourcing option and the total cost of existing e-mail services in order to determine the level of savings that can be expected.,0
  c) Estimated expenditures for each state agency associated with e-mail costs for the 2009-2010 fiscal year.,0
  d) The plan must identify any existing e-mail infrastructure that should be considered for reuse.,0
"  e) A concise analysis of the ability of each sourcing option to meet major system requirements, including federal and state requirements for confidentiality, privacy, and security.",0
"  f) A complete description of the scope of functionality, operations, and required resources associated with each sourcing option.",0
  g) Recommendations for standardizing the format of state e-mail addresses.,0
"  h) A reliable schedule for the decommission of all state agency e-mail systems and the migration of all agencies to the new system beginning by July 1, 2010, and completing by June 30, 2013.",0

 Requirements Workgroup Methodology Define the process by which requirements were gathered and grouped as either “basic” or “extended”.,0
"  The primary objective for the requirements workgroup was to gather all functional requirements for the state e-mail system (via excel spreadsheet) and compile all requirements into a complete, concise, and categorized functional requirements specification.",0
" The activities required to compile the requirements specification included reviewing the 2006 e-mail survey (and additional historical documentation), creating the 2009 e-mail survey, sending 2009 survey to agency e-mail (business) experts, compiling survey results into the formal requirements specification, and obtaining requirements approval from key stakeholders.",0
 Note: There are two subsequent surveys being sent out (to gather current agency inventory and financial information); the results of these two subsequent surveys are not included in this document.,0
  The workgroup reviewed the 2006 survey (and other data sources such as schedule IV-C data and AEIT DCC questionnaire) and determined the list of categories and questions to be included in the survey.,0
" Agencies were asked to respond to each requirement question by selecting “currently have and use”, “do not have/do not use”, or “would like to have”.",0
"  Agreed upon categories for the 2009 survey included E-mail, Calendar, & Contacts (user interface and administrative re quirements); Archiving, Retention, Search, Discovery requirements; Disaster Recovery requirements, Backup & Restore requirements; Security, Anti-Virus, Filtering requirements; Remote Access & Mobile Messaging requirements; Additional E-mail requirements.",0
 The survey also provided a section for agencies to address their concerns/issues regarding a statewide e-mail system.,0
"  Upon receiving all survey responses, the workgroup determined which requirements should be recommended for inclusion in the “basic” and “extended” section of the functional requirements specification.",0
" Factors that were considered in the basic or extended decision included, % of agencies that currently provide, # of total users currently supported, and the legal necessity of fulfilling the requirement.",0
" The workgroup also identified whether the requirement will be a user, agency admin, or SSRC admin capability.",0
"   Once approval of this document is obtained from key stakeholders, these functional requirements will be used as an attachment in upcoming RFI’s and potential RFP’s (or ITN’s).",0
 An in house or externally sourced solution should meet the basic functional requirements specified in this document (or provide ample reasoning why a requirement is not technically or financially feasible).,0

" Functional Requirements Summary   The functional requirements discovery and analysis process yielded the following results:  • Email, Calendar, and Contacts service category had a 97% “have and use” response average.",0
" • Archiving, Retention, Discovery service category had a 66% “have and use” response average and a 23% “would like to have” response average.",0
 • Disaster Recovery service category had a 59% “have and use” response average and a 34% “would like to have” response average.,0
 • Backup & Restore service category had a 79% “have and use” response average and a 19% “would like to have” response average.,0
" • Security, Anti-Virus, Filtering service category had a 67% “have and use” response average and a 24% “would like to have” response average.",0
" • Remote Access, Mobile Messaging service category had a 71% “have and use” response average and an 11% “would like to have” response average.",0
 • Additional E-mail service category had a 48% “have and use” response average and a 26% “would like to have” response average.,0
"   Based on these r esults, the majority of requirements for each category made it into the basic requirements recommendation.",0
" In each category except for email, calendar and contacts,  the survey showed that there is a potential need for extended services (varying service components, service levels, and costs).",0
" This is especially likely for the archiving, disaster recovery, security, and remote – mobile messaging categories.",0
 The survey also verified that more than half of agencies polled currently have and use a document collaboration and workflow application.,0
" However, in keeping within the scope of the statewide “e-mail, messaging, and calendaring” system proposal, it was agreed that collaboration services (such as shared documents and workflows, instant messaging, and discussion forums) should remain out of scope for this project.",0
" Finally, the technical and financial feasibility of each functional requirement will be further evaluated by the Enterprise E-mail technical and financial workgroups prior to submitting the proposed plan for statewide e-mail by December 31, 2009.",0
